",,,,,,,,This Python code defines a function `is_prime(n)` that checks whether a given number `n` is a prime number or not.,"This Python code defines a function `is_prime(n)` that determines whether a given integer `n` is a prime number or not. The function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1 and returns `False` in that case. It evaluates if the number is 2 or 3 and returns `True`. It also checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, and if so, returns `False`. Lastly, it uses a loop to check divisibility starting from 5 using the fact that all prime numbers other than 2 and 3 can be written in the form 6k +/- 1. If `n` is divisible by any number of the form `6k +/- 1` from 5 onwards, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.","This Python code defines a function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number. The function returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. It utilizes a common algorithm to efficiently determine if a number is prime by checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of `n`.","This Python code defines a function that checks whether a given number is a prime number or not. It includes logic to handle edge cases like numbers less than or equal to 1 and specific prime numbers like 2 and 3.

","This Python code defines two functions, `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`, that implement a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of 5 for encoding and decoding strings.

Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged. The shifted alphabet is created by shifting the lowercase alphabet cyclically to the right by two positions. The function returns the encrypted version of the input string.,This Python code defines a function called `encrypt` that takes a string as input and performs a simple substitution encryption. It shifts the entire lowercase alphabet by 2 positions to the left. Any character in the input string that is a lowercase letter will be replaced with the corresponding letter from the shifted alphabet. Other characters remain unchanged in the final encrypted string.,This Python code defines a function that performs a simple encryption technique on a given string. It shifts each lowercase letter in the input string by two positions in the alphabet and returns the encrypted string.,This Python code defines a function that takes a string as input and encrypts it using a simple Caesar cipher technique with a shift of 4 positions for each alphabetic character. The function returns the encrypted string.,This code defines a function `encrypt(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and encrypts it by shifting each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet (2 positions for lowercase letters and 2 positions for uppercase letters). It preserves non-letter characters as they are and returns the encrypted string.,This Python code defines a function that encrypts a given string using a Caesar cipher with a specific rotation of the alphabet. The function shifts each letter in the input string by 2 positions in the alphabet to create the encrypted text.,The code defines a function `encrypt(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and encrypts it using a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of 4 positions. It rotates each letter in the input string by 4 places in the alphabet (shift value of 2 * 2) and generates the encrypted string. The encryption logic handles both lowercase and uppercase alphabets while leaving other characters unchanged.,"This code defines a function named `encrypt` which takes a string `s` as input. The function modifies each character in the input string by shifting it 4 positions to the right in the English alphabet (taking into account the wrap-around at the end of the alphabet), and then returns the modified string.",This Python code defines a function `encrypt(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and encrypts it using a simple algorithm. The function shifts each alphabetical character in the input string by 2 positions to the right in the lowercase alphabet. Special characters and digits remain unchanged in the output. The encryption is performed based on the ASCII values of the characters.,This Python code defines a function that encrypts a given string by shifting each alphabet character by four positions to the right cyclically while maintaining the case of the character. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged in the encrypted result.,This Python code defines a function that takes a string and encrypts it by shifting the letters in the alphabet by 2 positions. It uses the `str.maketrans()` method to create a translation table for replacing each letter in the input string with the corresponding shifted letter. The function returns the encrypted string.,This Python code defines a function that encrypts a given string by shifting each letter in the alphabet two positions to the right.,"This Python code defines a function `encrypt` that shifts each letter in a given string by two positions to the right in the alphabet. It utilizes the `string` module to generate shifted versions of the lowercase alphabet, and then uses `translate` with `str.maketrans` to perform the encryption.",This code defines a function named `encrypt` that takes a string as input and encrypts it using a simple Caesar cipher technique. The shift value for encryption is calculated as 4 (2 * 2) positions to the right in the lowercase alphabet. Special characters and numbers remain unchanged in the encrypted string.,This Python code defines a function that takes a string as input and encrypts it using a simple Caesar cipher algorithm with a shift of 2 positions in the alphabet.,"This Python code implements a function to encrypt a given string by shifting each letter by a certain number of positions in the alphabet (in this case, by 2 positions).

Finally, it returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromic numbers found within the given range.",The code defines a function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` that counts the number of even and odd palindromic numbers up to the given input number n. It uses an inner function `count_evens(odds)` to calculate the count of even palindromic numbers based on the count of odd palindromic numbers calculated by the inner function `count_odds()`. It also uses the `is_palindrome(num)` function to check if a number is a palindrome. The function then returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd palindromic numbers.
