QUESTION:
An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
You have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $q$ painters to paint it. $i$-th painter will paint all sections $x$ such that $l_i \le x \le r_i$.

Unfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $q - 2$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.

You want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $q - 2$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \le n, q \le 5000$) — the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.

Then $q$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — maximum number of painted sections if you hire $q - 2$ painters.

QUESTION:
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.

QUESTION:
Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.

QUESTION:
You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! 

 $m$ 

Initially Zmei Gorynich has $x$ heads. You can deal $n$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $i$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $min(d_i, curX)$, there $curX$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $h_i$ new heads. If $curX = 0$ then Gorynich is defeated. 

You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.

For example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.

Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.

The following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th blow.


-----Output-----

For each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. 

If Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print $-1$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 10
6 3
8 2
1 4
4 10
4 1
3 2
2 6
1 100
2 15
10 11
14 100

Output
2
3
-1



-----Note-----

In the first query you can deal the first blow (after that the number of heads changes to $10 - 6 + 3 = 7$), and then deal the second blow.

In the second query you just deal the first blow three times, and Zmei is defeated. 

In third query you can not defeat Zmei Gorynich. Maybe it's better to convince it to stop fighting?

QUESTION:
Anton likes to listen to fairy tales, especially when Danik, Anton's best friend, tells them. Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:

""Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...""

More formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. 

Anton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^18) — the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time. Days are numbered starting with one.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2

Output
4

Input
8 1

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample the capacity of the barn is five grains and two grains are brought every day. The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. 

So the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.

QUESTION:
Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. 

Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.


-----Examples-----
Input
1s 2s 3s

Output
0

Input
9m 9m 9m

Output
0

Input
3p 9m 2p

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.

In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.

In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].

QUESTION:
Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 1

Output
1

Input
3
10 10
1 2 1 1
5 5 6 5
6 4 5 4
2 1 2 0

Output
2

Input
2
2 2
2 1 1 1
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 0

Output
-1



-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.

QUESTION:
On the planet Mars a year lasts exactly n days (there are no leap years on Mars). But Martians have the same weeks as earthlings — 5 work days and then 2 days off. Your task is to determine the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of days in a year on Mars.


-----Output-----

Print two integers — the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.


-----Examples-----
Input
14

Output
4 4

Input
2

Output
0 2



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are 14 days in a year on Mars, and therefore independently of the day a year starts with there will be exactly 4 days off .

In the second sample there are only 2 days in a year on Mars, and they can both be either work days or days off.

QUESTION:
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence ""GGGGGGGSGS"", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

QUESTION:
Now you can take online courses in the Berland State University! Polycarp needs to pass k main online courses of his specialty to get a diploma. In total n courses are availiable for the passage.

The situation is complicated by the dependence of online courses, for each course there is a list of those that must be passed before starting this online course (the list can be empty, it means that there is no limitation).

Help Polycarp to pass the least number of courses in total to get the specialty (it means to pass all main and necessary courses). Write a program which prints the order of courses. 

Polycarp passes courses consistently, he starts the next course when he finishes the previous one. Each course can't be passed more than once. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of online-courses and the number of main courses of Polycarp's specialty. 

The second line contains k distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of main online-courses of Polycarp's specialty. 

Then n lines follow, each of them describes the next course: the i-th of them corresponds to the course i. Each line starts from the integer t_{i} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ n - 1) — the number of courses on which the i-th depends. Then there follows the sequence of t_{i} distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of courses in random order, on which the i-th depends. It is guaranteed that no course can depend on itself. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values t_{i} doesn't exceed 10^5. 


-----Output-----

Print -1, if there is no the way to get a specialty. 

Otherwise, in the first line print the integer m — the minimum number of online-courses which it is necessary to pass to get a specialty. In the second line print m distinct integers — numbers of courses which it is necessary to pass in the chronological order of their passage. If there are several answers it is allowed to print any of them.

1 1

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test firstly you can take courses number 1 and 2, after that you can take the course number 4, then you can take the course number 5, which is the main. After that you have to take only the course number 3, which is the last not passed main course.

QUESTION:
Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).

You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:

  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty);  Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). 

You can perform these operations in arbitrary order.

If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.

For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:

  Remove 3 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 2 from a and push it into s;  Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. 

After all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.

You are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}). You may not swap or change any of first k elements of the permutation.

Print the lexicographically maximal permutation p you can obtain.

If there exists no answer then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ k < n) — the size of a desired permutation, and the number of elements you are given, respectively.

The second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the first k elements of p. These integers are pairwise distinct.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to restore a stack-sortable permutation p of size n such that the first k elements of p are equal to elements given in the input, print lexicographically maximal such permutation.

Otherwise print -1.

QUESTION:
Vasya likes everything infinite. Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s, such that its first element is equal to a (s_1 = a), and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c). In particular, Vasya wonders if his favourite integer b appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that s_{i} = b. Of course, you are the person he asks for a help.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contain three integers a, b and c ( - 10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) — the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number and the difference between any two neighbouring elements of the sequence, respectively.


-----Output-----

If b appears in the sequence s print ""YES"" (without quotes), otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7 3

Output
YES

Input
10 10 0

Output
YES

Input
1 -4 5

Output
NO

Input
0 60 50

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the sequence starts from integers 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element.

In the second sample, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.

In the third sample all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.

In the fourth sample, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.

QUESTION:
A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than ""("" and "")"". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters ""+"" and ""1"" into this sequence. For example, """", ""(())"" and ""()()"" are regular bracket sequences; ""))"" and "")(("" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and ""(a)"" and ""(1)+(1)"" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings ""(("", $cnt_2$ strings ""()"", $cnt_3$ strings "")("" and $cnt_4$ strings ""))"". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1

3

Output
1

Input
0
0

Output
1

Input

4

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string ""(())()(()((()()()())))"", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string """", which is a regular bracket sequence.

QUESTION:
Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.

All levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).

Polycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.

So he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers — $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).

Between two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.

Finally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.

Help him to check the correctness of his records.

For your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \le T \le 500)$ — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \le p_i, c_i \le 1000$) — the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.

Note that the stats are given in chronological order.


-----Output-----

For each test case print a single line.

If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print ""YES"".

Otherwise, print ""NO"".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
6
3
0 0
1 1
1 2
2
1 0
1000 3
4
10 1

765 432
2
4 4
4 3
5
0 0
1 0
1 0
1 0
1 0

Output
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES



-----Note-----

In the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.

The second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.

In the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.

The fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.

In the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.

Nobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.

QUESTION:
Karen is getting ready for a new school day!

 [Image] 

It is currently hh:mm, given in a 24-hour format. As you know, Karen loves palindromes, and she believes that it is good luck to wake up when the time is a palindrome.

What is the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome?

Remember that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, 05:39 is not a palindrome, because 05:39 backwards is 93:50. On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00 ≤  hh  ≤ 23, 00 ≤  mm  ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.


-----Examples-----
Input
05:39

Output
11

Input
13:31

Output
0

Input
23:59

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 11. She can wake up at 05:50, when the time is a palindrome.

In the second test case, Karen can wake up immediately, as the current time, 13:31, is already a palindrome.

In the third test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 1 minute. She can wake up at 00:00, when the time is a palindrome.

QUESTION:
Nicholas has an array a that contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. In other words, Nicholas has a permutation of size n.

Nicholas want the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) to be as far as possible from each other. He wants to perform exactly one swap in order to maximize the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. The distance between two elements is considered to be equal to the absolute difference between their positions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of the permutation.

The second line of the input contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n), where a_{i} is equal to the element at the i-th position.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
4 5 1 3 2

Output
3

Input
7
1 6 5 3 4 7 2

Output
6

Input
6
6 5 4 3 2 1

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, one may obtain the optimal answer by swapping elements 1 and 2.

In the second sample, the minimum and the maximum elements will be located in the opposite ends of the array if we swap 7 and 2.

In the third sample, the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements is already maximum possible, so we just perform some unnecessary swap, for example, one can swap 5 and 2.

QUESTION:
Alice and Bob play 5-in-a-row game. They have a playing field of size 10 × 10. In turns they put either crosses or noughts, one at a time. Alice puts crosses and Bob puts noughts.

In current match they have made some turns and now it's Alice's turn. She wonders if she can put cross in such empty cell that she wins immediately.

Alice wins if some crosses in the field form line of length not smaller than 5. This line can be horizontal, vertical and diagonal.


-----Input-----

You are given matrix 10 × 10 (10 lines of 10 characters each) with capital Latin letters 'X' being a cross, letters 'O' being a nought and '.' being an empty cell. The number of 'X' cells is equal to the number of 'O' cells and there is at least one of each type. There is at least one empty cell.

It is guaranteed that in the current arrangement nobody has still won.


-----Output-----

Print 'YES' if it's possible for Alice to win in one turn by putting cross in some empty cell. Otherwise print 'NO'.


-----Examples-----
Input
XX.XX.....
.....OOOO.
..........
..........
..........

Output
YES

Input
XXOXX.....
OO.O......

QUESTION:
Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. 

Let m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.

 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.


-----Output-----

Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

1.1 3.4 2.5

Output

Output

QUESTION:
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

QUESTION:
The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, ""1"", ""2"", ..., ""n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the ""move"" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is ""move file_1 file_2"", that means that the file ""file_1"" is to be renamed to ""file_2"". If there is a file ""file_2"" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line ""move file_1 file_2"" the file ""file_1"" doesn't exist, but there is a file ""file_2"" with content equal to the content of ""file_1"" before the ""move"" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames ""1"", ""2"", ..., ""e"", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames ""e + 1"", ""e + 2"", ..., ""n"", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of ""name_i type_i"", where ""name_i"" is the filename, and ""type_i"" equals ""1"", if the i-th file contains an example test, and ""0"" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be ""move file_1 file_2"", where ""file_1"" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and ""file_2"" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

QUESTION:
Luba has a ticket consisting of 6 digits. In one move she can choose digit in any position and replace it with arbitrary digit. She wants to know the minimum number of digits she needs to replace in order to make the ticket lucky.

The ticket is considered lucky if the sum of first three digits equals to the sum of last three digits.


-----Input-----

You are given a string consisting of 6 characters (all characters are digits from 0 to 9) — this string denotes Luba's ticket. The ticket can start with the digit 0.


-----Output-----

Print one number — the minimum possible number of digits Luba needs to replace to make the ticket lucky.


-----Examples-----
Input
000000

Output
0

Input
123456

Output
2

Input
111000

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket is already lucky, so the answer is 0.

In the second example Luba can replace 4 and 5 with zeroes, and the ticket will become lucky. It's easy to see that at least two replacements are required.

In the third example Luba can replace any zero with 3. It's easy to see that at least one replacement is required.

QUESTION:
The campus has $m$ rooms numbered from $0$ to $m - 1$. Also the $x$-mouse lives in the campus. The $x$-mouse is not just a mouse: each second $x$-mouse moves from room $i$ to the room $i \cdot x \mod{m}$ (in fact, it teleports from one room to another since it doesn't visit any intermediate room). Starting position of the $x$-mouse is unknown.

You are responsible to catch the $x$-mouse in the campus, so you are guessing about minimum possible number of traps (one trap in one room) you need to place. You are sure that if the $x$-mouse enters a trapped room, it immediately gets caught.

And the only observation you made is $\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $m$ and $x$ ($2 \le m \le 10^{14}$, $1 \le x < m$, $\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$) — the number of rooms and the parameter of $x$-mouse. 


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — minimum number of traps you need to install to catch the $x$-mouse.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3

Output
3

Input
5 2

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example you can, for example, put traps in rooms $0$, $2$, $3$. If the $x$-mouse starts in one of this rooms it will be caught immediately. If $x$-mouse starts in the $1$-st rooms then it will move to the room $3$, where it will be caught.

In the second example you can put one trap in room $0$ and one trap in any other room since $x$-mouse will visit all rooms $1..m-1$ if it will start in any of these rooms.

QUESTION:
ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2

Output
1 8
Input
1 3

Output
1 1
Input
4 3

Output
23 128


-----Note-----

In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.

In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.

QUESTION:
In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: ""North"", ""South"", ""West"", ""East"".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print ""YES"" or ""NO"" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print ""NO"", both without the quotes.


-----Examples-----

7500 South
10000 East

QUESTION:
It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.

QUESTION:
The flag of Berland is such rectangular field n × m that satisfies following conditions:

  Flag consists of three colors which correspond to letters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.  Flag consists of three equal in width and height stripes, parralel to each other and to sides of the flag. Each stripe has exactly one color.  Each color should be used in exactly one stripe. 

You are given a field n × m, consisting of characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'. Output ""YES"" (without quotes) if this field corresponds to correct flag of Berland. Otherwise, print ""NO"" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the field.

Each of the following n lines consisting of m characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — the description of the field.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (without quotes) if the given field corresponds to correct flag of Berland . Otherwise, print ""NO"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
Dante is engaged in a fight with ""The Savior"". Before he can fight it with his sword, he needs to break its shields. He has two guns, Ebony and Ivory, each of them is able to perform any non-negative number of shots.

For every bullet that hits the shield, Ebony deals a units of damage while Ivory deals b units of damage. In order to break the shield Dante has to deal exactly c units of damage. Find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000) — the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print ""Yes"" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and ""No"" (without quotes) otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 15

Output
No

Input
3 2 7

Output
Yes

Input
6 11 6

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the second sample, Dante can fire 1 bullet from Ebony and 2 from Ivory to deal exactly 1·3 + 2·2 = 7 damage. In the third sample, Dante can fire 1 bullet from ebony and no bullets from ivory to do 1·6 + 0·11 = 6 damage.

QUESTION:
Running with barriers on the circle track is very popular in the country where Dasha lives, so no wonder that on her way to classes she saw the following situation:

The track is the circle with length L, in distinct points of which there are n barriers. Athlete always run the track in counterclockwise direction if you look on him from above. All barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track. 

Her friends the parrot Kefa and the leopard Sasha participated in competitions and each of them ran one lap. Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track. Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the n barriers. Thus, each of them wrote n integers in the ascending order, each of them was between 0 and L - 1, inclusively. [Image] Consider an example. Let L = 8, blue points are barriers, and green points are Kefa's start (A) and Sasha's start (B). Then Kefa writes down the sequence [2, 4, 6], and Sasha writes down [1, 5, 7]. 

There are several tracks in the country, all of them have same length and same number of barriers, but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks. Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks. 

Write the program which will check that Kefa's and Sasha's tracks coincide (it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position). Note that they always run the track in one direction — counterclockwise, if you look on a track from above. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, n ≤ L ≤ 100) — the number of barriers on a track and its length. 

The second line contains n distinct integers in the ascending order — the distance from Kefa's start to each barrier in the order of its appearance. All integers are in the range from 0 to L - 1 inclusively.

The second line contains n distinct integers in the ascending order — the distance from Sasha's start to each barrier in the order of its overcoming. All integers are in the range from 0 to L - 1 inclusively.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (without quotes), if Kefa and Sasha ran the coinciding tracks (it means that the position of all barriers coincides, if they start running from the same points on the track). Otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).

QUESTION:
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings ""kek"", ""abacaba"", ""r"" and ""papicipap"" are palindromes, while the strings ""abb"" and ""iq"" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

""mew"" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string ""mew"" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string ""uffuw"" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string ""wuffuw"", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string ""qqqqqqqq"" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.

QUESTION:
Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print ""rated"". If the round is unrated for sure, print ""unrated"". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print ""maybe"".


-----Examples-----

2194 2194

Output

Input

2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.

QUESTION:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string ""000111"" contains substrings ""001"", ""01110"" and ""10"", but doesn't contain ""0110"" and ""10110"".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

QUESTION:
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
Vasiliy has a car and he wants to get from home to the post office. The distance which he needs to pass equals to d kilometers.

Vasiliy's car is not new — it breaks after driven every k kilometers and Vasiliy needs t seconds to repair it. After repairing his car Vasiliy can drive again (but after k kilometers it will break again, and so on). In the beginning of the trip the car is just from repair station.

To drive one kilometer on car Vasiliy spends a seconds, to walk one kilometer on foot he needs b seconds (a < b).

Your task is to find minimal time after which Vasiliy will be able to reach the post office. Consider that in every moment of time Vasiliy can left his car and start to go on foot.


-----Input-----

The first line contains 5 positive integers d, k, a, b, t (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^12; 1 ≤ k, a, b, t ≤ 10^6; a < b), where:  d — the distance from home to the post office;  k — the distance, which car is able to drive before breaking;  a — the time, which Vasiliy spends to drive 1 kilometer on his car;  b — the time, which Vasiliy spends to walk 1 kilometer on foot;  t — the time, which Vasiliy spends to repair his car. 


-----Output-----

Print the minimal time after which Vasiliy will be able to reach the post office.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 1 4 10

Output
14

Input
5 2 1 4 5

Output
13



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasiliy needs to drive the first 2 kilometers on the car (in 2 seconds) and then to walk on foot 3 kilometers (in 12 seconds). So the answer equals to 14 seconds.

In the second example Vasiliy needs to drive the first 2 kilometers on the car (in 2 seconds), then repair his car (in 5 seconds) and drive 2 kilometers more on the car (in 2 seconds). After that he needs to walk on foot 1 kilometer (in 4 seconds). So the answer equals to 13 seconds.

QUESTION:
You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. Beauty of array is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray of this array (this subarray may be empty). For example, the beauty of the array [10, -5, 10, -4, 1] is 15, and the beauty of the array [-3, -5, -1] is 0.

You may choose at most one consecutive subarray of $a$ and multiply all values contained in this subarray by $x$. You want to maximize the beauty of array after applying at most one such operation.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, -100 \le x \le 100$) — the length of array $a$ and the integer $x$ respectively.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the array $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum possible beauty of array $a$ after multiplying all values belonging to some consecutive subarray $x$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 -2
-3 8 -2 1 -6

Output
22

Input
12 -3
1 3 3 7 1 3 3 7 1 3 3 7

Output
42

Input
5 10
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test case we need to multiply the subarray [-2, 1, -6], and the array becomes [-3, 8, 4, -2, 12] with beauty 22 ([-3, 8, 4, -2, 12]).

In the second test case we don't need to multiply any subarray at all.

In the third test case no matter which subarray we multiply, the beauty of array will be equal to 0.

QUESTION:
Bizon the Champion isn't just charming, he also is very smart.

While some of us were learning the multiplication table, Bizon the Champion had fun in his own manner. Bizon the Champion painted an n × m multiplication table, where the element on the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column equals i·j (the rows and columns of the table are numbered starting from 1). Then he was asked: what number in the table is the k-th largest number? Bizon the Champion always answered correctly and immediately. Can you repeat his success?

Consider the given multiplication table. If you write out all n·m numbers from the table in the non-decreasing order, then the k-th number you write out is called the k-th largest number.


-----Input-----

The single line contains integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5·10^5; 1 ≤ k ≤ n·m).


-----Output-----

Print the k-th largest number in a n × m multiplication table.

QUESTION:
Welcome to Codeforces Stock Exchange! We're pretty limited now as we currently allow trading on one stock, Codeforces Ltd. We hope you'll still be able to make profit from the market!

In the morning, there are $n$ opportunities to buy shares. The $i$-th of them allows to buy as many shares as you want, each at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

In the evening, there are $m$ opportunities to sell shares. The $i$-th of them allows to sell as many shares as you want, each at the price of $b_i$ bourles. You can't sell more shares than you have.

It's morning now and you possess $r$ bourles and no shares.

What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
4 2 5
4 4 5 4

Output
26

Input
2 2 50
5 7
4 2

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.

Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. 

Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).

По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. 

Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.


-----Входные данные-----

В единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.


-----Выходные данные-----

Если сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.

В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.

QUESTION:
Daniel is organizing a football tournament. He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\frac{x \cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. 

For example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.

Daniel has already booked the stadium for n games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly n games. You should print all possible numbers of teams that will yield exactly n games in ascending order, or -1 if there are no such numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), the number of games that should be played.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.


-----Output-----

Print all possible numbers of invited teams in ascending order, one per line. If exactly n games cannot be played, output one number: -1.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
A string a of length m is called antipalindromic iff m is even, and for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) a_{i} ≠ a_{m} - i + 1.

Ivan has a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters; n is even. He wants to form some string t that will be an antipalindromic permutation of s. Also Ivan has denoted the beauty of index i as b_{i}, and the beauty of t as the sum of b_{i} among all indices i such that s_{i} = t_{i}.

Help Ivan to determine maximum possible beauty of t he can get.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, n is even) — the number of characters in s.

The second line contains the string s itself. It consists of only lowercase Latin letters, and it is guaranteed that its letters can be reordered to form an antipalindromic string.

The third line contains n integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 100), where b_{i} is the beauty of index i.


-----Output-----

Print one number — the maximum possible beauty of t.

QUESTION:
Vanya has a scales for weighing loads and weights of masses w^0, w^1, w^2, ..., w^100 grams where w is some integer not less than 2 (exactly one weight of each nominal value). Vanya wonders whether he can weight an item with mass m using the given weights, if the weights can be put on both pans of the scales. Formally speaking, your task is to determine whether it is possible to place an item of mass m and some weights on the left pan of the scales, and some weights on the right pan of the scales so that the pans of the scales were in balance.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers w, m (2 ≤ w ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number defining the masses of the weights and the mass of the item.


-----Output-----

Print word 'YES' if the item can be weighted and 'NO' if it cannot.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7

Output
YES

Input
100 99

Output
YES

Input
100 50

Output
NO



-----Note-----

Note to the first sample test. One pan can have an item of mass 7 and a weight of mass 3, and the second pan can have two weights of masses 9 and 1, correspondingly. Then 7 + 3 = 9 + 1.

Note to the second sample test. One pan of the scales can have an item of mass 99 and the weight of mass 1, and the second pan can have the weight of mass 100.

Note to the third sample test. It is impossible to measure the weight of the item in the manner described in the input.

QUESTION:
Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output ""No"" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output ""Yes"" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.

QUESTION:
Mary has just graduated from one well-known University and is now attending celebration party. Students like to dream of a beautiful life, so they used champagne glasses to construct a small pyramid. The height of the pyramid is n. The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses.

Vlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid.

Each second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately. Vlad is interested in the number of completely full glasses if he stops pouring champagne in t seconds.

Pictures below illustrate the pyramid consisting of three levels. [Image] [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 0 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the height of the pyramid and the number of seconds Vlad will be pouring champagne from the bottle.


-----Output-----

Print the single integer — the number of completely full glasses after t seconds.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 5

Output
4

Input
4 8

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the glasses full after 5 seconds are: the top glass, both glasses on the second level and the middle glass at the bottom level. Left and right glasses of the bottom level will be half-empty.

QUESTION:
After making bad dives into swimming pools, Wilbur wants to build a swimming pool in the shape of a rectangle in his backyard. He has set up coordinate axes, and he wants the sides of the rectangle to be parallel to them. Of course, the area of the rectangle must be positive. Wilbur had all four vertices of the planned pool written on a paper, until his friend came along and erased some of the vertices.

Now Wilbur is wondering, if the remaining n vertices of the initial rectangle give enough information to restore the area of the planned swimming pool.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4) — the number of vertices that were not erased by Wilbur's friend.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 1000 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 1000) —the coordinates of the i-th vertex that remains. Vertices are given in an arbitrary order.

It's guaranteed that these points are distinct vertices of some rectangle, that has positive area and which sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.


-----Output-----

Print the area of the initial rectangle if it could be uniquely determined by the points remaining. Otherwise, print  - 1. 


-----Examples-----
Input
2
0 0
1 1

Output
1

Input
1
1 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, two opposite corners of the initial rectangle are given, and that gives enough information to say that the rectangle is actually a unit square.

In the second sample there is only one vertex left and this is definitely not enough to uniquely define the area.

QUESTION:
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

QUESTION:
You have an array a consisting of n integers. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in this array.

For some indices i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) it is possible to swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th, for other indices it is not possible. You may perform any number of swapping operations any order. There is no limit on the number of times you swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th (if the position is not forbidden).

Can you make this array sorted in ascending order performing some sequence of swapping operations?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 200000) — the elements of the array. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.

The third line contains a string of n - 1 characters, each character is either 0 or 1. If i-th character is 1, then you can swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th any number of times, otherwise it is forbidden to swap i-th element with (i + 1)-th.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to sort the array in ascending order using any sequence of swaps you are allowed to make, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle.  [Image] 

 

It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.

Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one — in seat 'c'. Assume that all seats are occupied.

Vasya has seat s in row n and wants to know how many seconds will pass before he gets his lunch.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) is the index of the row and s is the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'. The index of the row and the seat are not separated by a space.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch.


-----Examples-----
Input
1f

Output
1

Input
2d

Output
10

Input
4a

Output
11

Input
5e

Output
18



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the first flight attendant serves Vasya first, so Vasya gets his lunch after 1 second.

In the second sample, the flight attendants will spend 6 seconds to serve everyone in the rows 1 and 3, then they will move one row forward in 1 second. As they first serve seats located to the right of the aisle in order from window to aisle, Vasya has to wait 3 more seconds. The total is 6 + 1 + 3 = 10.

QUESTION:
After seeing the ""ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US"" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output

Output
<

Input
7 16
15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.

QUESTION:
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either ""BitLGM"" or ""BitAryo"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».

QUESTION:
Vector Willman and Array Bolt are the two most famous athletes of Byteforces. They are going to compete in a race with a distance of L meters today.

 [Image] 

Willman and Bolt have exactly the same speed, so when they compete the result is always a tie. That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. 

While watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to w meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to b meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). 

Note that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance L.

Since the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to t (both are included). What is the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers t, w and b (1 ≤ t, w, b ≤ 5·10^18) — the maximum possible length of the racetrack, the length of Willman's steps and the length of Bolt's steps respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the answer to the problem as an irreducible fraction [Image]. Follow the format of the samples output.

The fraction [Image] (p and q are integers, and both p ≥ 0 and q > 0 holds) is called irreducible, if there is no such integer d > 1, that both p and q are divisible by d.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 3 2

Output
3/10

Input
7 1 2

Output
3/7



-----Note-----

In the first sample Willman and Bolt will tie in case 1, 6 or 7 are chosen as the length of the racetrack.

QUESTION:
Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be ""+""; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be ""-""; otherwise the result will be ""0"".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : ""+"", ""-"" or ""0"".

Otherwise, print ""?"" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is ""-"".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is ""+"".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is ""0"".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be ""+"", otherwise, the result would be ""-"". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.

QUESTION:
Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.

QUESTION:
You are given string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of 0-s and 1-s. You build an infinite string $t$ as a concatenation of an infinite number of strings $s$, or $t = ssss \dots$ For example, if $s =$ 10010, then $t =$ 100101001010010...

Calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The balance of some string $q$ is equal to $cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$, where $cnt_{0, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 0 in $q$, and $cnt_{1, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 1 in $q$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.

A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string ""abcd"" has 5 prefixes: empty string, ""a"", ""ab"", ""abc"" and ""abcd"".


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) — the length of string $s$ and the desired balance, respectively.

The second line contains the binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{\text{0}, \text{1}\}$).

It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of prefixes or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes.


-----Example-----
Input
4
6 10
010010
5 3
10101
1 0
0
2 0
01

Output
3
0
1
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test case, there are 3 good prefixes of $t$: with length $28$, $30$ and $32$.

QUESTION:
Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.

QUESTION:
On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;

QUESTION:
After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.

The three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.

A random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.

The rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.

Could you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 10^{9}$) — the number of turns.

Next 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.


-----Output-----

Print the name of the winner (""Kuro"", ""Shiro"" or ""Katie""). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print ""Draw"".


-----Examples-----
Input
3
Kuroo
Shiro
Katie

Output
Kuro

Input
7

Output
Shiro

Input
1
abcabc
cbabac
ababca

Output
Katie

Input
15
foPaErcvJ
mZaxowpbt
mkuOlaHRE

Output
Draw



-----Note-----

In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.

In the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.

QUESTION:
Mister B once received a gift: it was a book about aliens, which he started read immediately. This book had c pages.

At first day Mister B read v_0 pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read a pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read v_0 pages, at second — v_0 + a pages, at third — v_0 + 2a pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than v_1 pages per day.

Also, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last l pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.

Help Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.


-----Input-----

First and only line contains five space-separated integers: c, v_0, v_1, a and l (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 5 10 5 4

Output
1

Input
12 4 12 4 1

Output
3

Input
15 1 100 0 0

Output
15



-----Note-----

In the first sample test the book contains 5 pages, so Mister B read it right at the first day.

In the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number 1 - 4, at second day — 4 - 11, at third day — 11 - 12 and finished the book.

In third sample test every day Mister B read 1 page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.

QUESTION:
Dima loves representing an odd number as the sum of multiple primes, and Lisa loves it when there are at most three primes. Help them to represent the given number as the sum of at most than three primes.

More formally, you are given an odd numer n. Find a set of numbers p_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ k), such that



 1 ≤ k ≤ 3

 p_{i} is a prime

 $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} p_{i} = n$

The numbers p_{i} do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that at least one possible solution exists.


-----Input-----

The single line contains an odd number n (3 ≤ n < 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the first line print k (1 ≤ k ≤ 3), showing how many numbers are in the representation you found.

In the second line print numbers p_{i} in any order. If there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
27

Output
3
5 11 11



-----Note-----

A prime is an integer strictly larger than one that is divisible only by one and by itself.

QUESTION:
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (""."") or it can be occupied by a wall (""*""). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols ""."" and ""*"" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ""."", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals ""*"" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print ""NO"" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

QUESTION:
Berland Football Cup starts really soon! Commentators from all over the world come to the event.

Organizers have already built $n$ commentary boxes. $m$ regional delegations will come to the Cup. Every delegation should get the same number of the commentary boxes. If any box is left unoccupied then the delegations will be upset. So each box should be occupied by exactly one delegation.

If $n$ is not divisible by $m$, it is impossible to distribute the boxes to the delegations at the moment.

Organizers can build a new commentary box paying $a$ burles and demolish a commentary box paying $b$ burles. They can both build and demolish boxes arbitrary number of times (each time paying a corresponding fee). It is allowed to demolish all the existing boxes.

What is the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by $m$)?


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integer numbers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^{12}$, $1 \le a, b \le 100$), where $n$ is the initial number of the commentary boxes, $m$ is the number of delegations to come, $a$ is the fee to build a box and $b$ is the fee to demolish a box.


-----Output-----

Output the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by $m$). It is allowed that the final number of the boxes is equal to $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 7 3 8

Output
15

Input
2 7 3 7

Output
14

Input
30 6 17 19

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example organizers can build $5$ boxes to make the total of $14$ paying $3$ burles for the each of them.

In the second example organizers can demolish $2$ boxes to make the total of $0$ paying $7$ burles for the each of them.

In the third example organizers are already able to distribute all the boxes equally among the delegations, each one get $5$ boxes.

QUESTION:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Polycarp loves to listen to music, so he never leaves the player, even on the way home from the university. Polycarp overcomes the distance from the university to the house in exactly $T$ minutes.

In the player, Polycarp stores $n$ songs, each of which is characterized by two parameters: $t_i$ and $g_i$, where $t_i$ is the length of the song in minutes ($1 \le t_i \le 15$), $g_i$ is its genre ($1 \le g_i \le 3$).

Polycarp wants to create such a playlist so that he can listen to music all the time on the way from the university to his home, and at the time of his arrival home, the playlist is over. Polycarp never interrupts songs and always listens to them from beginning to end. Thus, if he started listening to the $i$-th song, he would spend exactly $t_i$ minutes on its listening. Polycarp also does not like when two songs of the same genre play in a row (i.e. successively/adjacently) or when the songs in his playlist are repeated.

Help Polycarpus count the number of different sequences of songs (their order matters), the total duration is exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $T$ ($1 \le n \le 15, 1 \le T \le 225$) — the number of songs in the player and the required total duration, respectively.

Next, the $n$ lines contain descriptions of songs: the $i$-th line contains two integers $t_i$ and $g_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 15, 1 \le g_i \le 3$) — the duration of the $i$-th song and its genre, respectively.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the number of different sequences of songs, the total length of exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different. Since the answer may be huge, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$ (that is, the remainder when dividing the quantity by $10^9 + 7$).

Input
3 3
1 1
1 2

1 3

Output
2

Input
4 10
5 3
2 1
3 2
5 1

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, Polycarp can make any of the $6$ possible playlist by rearranging the available songs: $[1, 2, 3]$, $[1, 3, 2]$, $[2, 1, 3]$, $[2, 3, 1]$, $[3, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 2, 1]$ (indices of the songs are given).

In the second example, the first and second songs cannot go in succession (since they have the same genre). Thus, Polycarp can create a playlist in one of $2$ possible ways: $[1, 3, 2]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ (indices of the songs are given).

In the third example, Polycarp can make the following playlists: $[1, 2, 3]$, $[1, 3, 2]$, $[2, 1, 3]$, $[2, 3, 1]$, $[3, 1, 2]$, $[3, 2, 1]$, $[1, 4]$, $[4, 1]$, $[2, 3, 4]$ and $[4, 3, 2]$ (indices of the songs are given).

QUESTION:
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

QUESTION:
Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.

QUESTION:
Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.

QUESTION:
Noora is a student of one famous high school. It's her final year in school — she is going to study in university next year. However, she has to get an «A» graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.

In school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to k. The worst mark is 1, the best is k. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784 — to 8. 

For instance, if Noora has marks [8, 9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8, 8, 9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.

To graduate with «A» certificate, Noora has to have mark k.

Noora got n marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark k. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to k. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) denoting the number of marks, received by Noora and the value of highest possible mark.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ k) denoting marks received by Noora before Leha's hack.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to k.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 10
8 9

Output
4
Input
3 5
4 4 4

Output
3


-----Note-----

Consider the first example testcase.

Maximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks — 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10, 10, 10, 10] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to $\frac{8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10}{6} = \frac{57}{6} = 9.5$. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.

In the second example Leha can add [5, 5, 5] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate.

QUESTION:
You are given an array of $n$ integers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Your task is to find some non-zero integer $d$ ($-10^3 \leq d \leq 10^3$) such that, after each number in the array is divided by $d$, the number of positive numbers that are presented in the array is greater than or equal to half of the array size (i.e., at least $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$). Note that those positive numbers do not need to be an integer (e.g., a $2.5$ counts as a positive number). If there are multiple values of $d$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.

Recall that $\lceil x \rceil$ represents the smallest integer that is not less than $x$ and that zero ($0$) is neither positive nor negative.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

Print one integer $d$ ($-10^3 \leq d \leq 10^3$ and $d \neq 0$) that satisfies the given condition. If there are multiple values of $d$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input

10 0 -7 2 6
Output
4
Input
7
0 0 1 -1 0 0 2

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first sample, $n = 5$, so we need at least $\lceil\frac{5}{2}\rceil = 3$ positive numbers after division. If $d = 4$, the array after division is $[2.5, 0, -1.75, 0.5, 1.5]$, in which there are $3$ positive numbers (namely: $2.5$, $0.5$, and $1.5$).

In the second sample, there is no valid $d$, so $0$ should be printed.

QUESTION:
There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.

QUESTION:
Polycarpus likes giving presents to Paraskevi. He has bought two chocolate bars, each of them has the shape of a segmented rectangle. The first bar is a_1 × b_1 segments large and the second one is a_2 × b_2 segments large.

Polycarpus wants to give Paraskevi one of the bars at the lunch break and eat the other one himself. Besides, he wants to show that Polycarpus's mind and Paraskevi's beauty are equally matched, so the two bars must have the same number of squares.

To make the bars have the same number of squares, Polycarpus eats a little piece of chocolate each minute. Each minute he does the following:  he either breaks one bar exactly in half (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a half of the bar,  or he chips of exactly one third of a bar (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a third of the bar. 

In the first case he is left with a half, of the bar and in the second case he is left with two thirds of the bar.

Both variants aren't always possible, and sometimes Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third. For example, if the bar is 16 × 23, then Polycarpus can chip off a half, but not a third. If the bar is 20 × 18, then Polycarpus can chip off both a half and a third. If the bar is 5 × 7, then Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third.

What is the minimum number of minutes Polycarpus needs to make two bars consist of the same number of squares? Find not only the required minimum number of minutes, but also the possible sizes of the bars after the process.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integers a_1, b_1 (1 ≤ a_1, b_1 ≤ 10^9) — the initial sizes of the first chocolate bar. The second line of the input contains integers a_2, b_2 (1 ≤ a_2, b_2 ≤ 10^9) — the initial sizes of the second bar.

You can use the data of type int64 (in Pascal), long long (in С++), long (in Java) to process large integers (exceeding 2^31 - 1).


-----Output-----

In the first line print m — the sought minimum number of minutes. In the second and third line print the possible sizes of the bars after they are leveled in m minutes. Print the sizes using the format identical to the input format. Print the sizes (the numbers in the printed pairs) in any order. The second line must correspond to the first bar and the third line must correspond to the second bar. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

If there is no solution, print a single line with integer -1.

QUESTION:
Polycarp and Vasiliy love simple logical games. Today they play a game with infinite chessboard and one pawn for each player. Polycarp and Vasiliy move in turns, Polycarp starts. In each turn Polycarp can move his pawn from cell (x, y) to (x - 1, y) or (x, y - 1). Vasiliy can move his pawn from (x, y) to one of cells: (x - 1, y), (x - 1, y - 1) and (x, y - 1). Both players are also allowed to skip move. 

There are some additional restrictions — a player is forbidden to move his pawn to a cell with negative x-coordinate or y-coordinate or to the cell containing opponent's pawn The winner is the first person to reach cell (0, 0). 

You are given the starting coordinates of both pawns. Determine who will win if both of them play optimally well.

The first line contains four integers: x_{p}, y_{p}, x_{v}, y_{v} (0 ≤ x_{p}, y_{p}, x_{v}, y_{v} ≤ 10^5) — Polycarp's and Vasiliy's starting coordinates.

It is guaranteed that in the beginning the pawns are in different cells and none of them is in the cell (0, 0).


-----Output-----

Output the name of the winner: ""Polycarp"" or ""Vasiliy"".


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1 2 2

Output
Polycarp

Input
4 7 7 4

Output
Vasiliy



-----Note-----

In the first sample test Polycarp starts in (2, 1) and will move to (1, 1) in the first turn. No matter what his opponent is doing, in the second turn Polycarp can move to (1, 0) and finally to (0, 0) in the third turn.

QUESTION:
Petr wants to make a calendar for current month. For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture: $\left. \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline & {2} & {9} & {16} & {23} & {30} \\ \hline & {3} & {10} & {17} & {24} & {31} \\ \hline & {4} & {11} & {18} & {25} & {} \\ \hline & {5} & {12} & {19} & {26} & {} \\ \hline & {6} & {13} & {20} & {27} & {} \\ \hline & {7} & {14} & {21} & {28} & {} \\ \hline 1 & {8} & {15} & {22} & {29} & {} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ 

Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.


-----Input-----

The only line contain two integers m and d (1 ≤ m ≤ 12, 1 ≤ d ≤ 7) — the number of month (January is the first month, December is the twelfth) and the weekday of the first date of this month (1 is Monday, 7 is Sunday).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: the number of columns the table should have.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7

Output
6

Input
1 1

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
5



-----Note-----

The first example corresponds to the January 2017 shown on the picture in the statements.

In the second example 1-st January is Monday, so the whole month fits into 5 columns.

In the third example 1-st November is Saturday and 5 columns is enough.

QUESTION:
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

QUESTION:
Anya loves to fold and stick. Today she decided to do just that.

Anya has n cubes lying in a line and numbered from 1 to n from left to right, with natural numbers written on them. She also has k stickers with exclamation marks. We know that the number of stickers does not exceed the number of cubes.

Anya can stick an exclamation mark on the cube and get the factorial of the number written on the cube. For example, if a cube reads 5, then after the sticking it reads 5!, which equals 120.

You need to help Anya count how many ways there are to choose some of the cubes and stick on some of the chosen cubes at most k exclamation marks so that the sum of the numbers written on the chosen cubes after the sticking becomes equal to S. Anya can stick at most one exclamation mark on each cube. Can you do it?

Two ways are considered the same if they have the same set of chosen cubes and the same set of cubes with exclamation marks.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, k and S (1 ≤ n ≤ 25, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ S ≤ 10^16) — the number of cubes and the number of stickers that Anya has, and the sum that she needs to get. 

The second line contains n positive integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers, written on the cubes. The cubes in the input are described in the order from left to right, starting from the first one. 

Multiple cubes can contain the same numbers.


-----Output-----

Output the number of ways to choose some number of cubes and stick exclamation marks on some of them so that the sum of the numbers became equal to the given number S.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 30
4 3

Output
1

Input
2 2 7
4 3

Output
1

Input
3 1 1
1 1 1

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample the only way is to choose both cubes and stick an exclamation mark on each of them.

In the second sample the only way is to choose both cubes but don't stick an exclamation mark on any of them.

In the third sample it is possible to choose any of the cubes in three ways, and also we may choose to stick or not to stick the exclamation mark on it. So, the total number of ways is six.

QUESTION:
Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at $i$-th step ($0$-indexed) you can:   either choose position $pos$ ($1 \le pos \le n$) and increase $v_{pos}$ by $k^i$;  or not choose any position and skip this step. 

You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array $v$ equal to the given array $a$ ($v_j = a_j$ for each $j$) after some step?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Next $2T$ lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 30$, $2 \le k \le 100$) — the size of arrays $v$ and $a$ and value $k$ used in the algorithm.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^{16}$) — the array you'd like to achieve.


-----Output-----

For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if you can achieve the array $a$ after some step or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.


-----Example-----
Input
5
4 100
0 0 0 0
1 2
1
3 4
1 4 1
3 2
0 1 3
3 9
0 59049 810

Output
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES



-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the $0$-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.

In the second test case, you can add $k^0$ to $v_1$ and stop the algorithm.

In the third test case, you can't make two $1$ in the array $v$.

In the fifth test case, you can skip $9^0$ and $9^1$, then add $9^2$ and $9^3$ to $v_3$, skip $9^4$ and finally, add $9^5$ to $v_2$.

QUESTION:
Let's denote d(n) as the number of divisors of a positive integer n. You are given three integers a, b and c. Your task is to calculate the following sum:

$\sum_{i = 1}^{a} \sum_{j = 1}^{b} \sum_{k = 1}^{c} d(i \cdot j \cdot k)$

Find the sum modulo 1073741824 (2^30).


-----Input-----

The first line contains three space-separated integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the required sum modulo 1073741824 (2^30).


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 2

Output
20

Input
5 6 7

Output
1520



-----Note-----

For the first example.

  d(1·1·1) = d(1) = 1;  d(1·1·2) = d(2) = 2;  d(1·2·1) = d(2) = 2;  d(1·2·2) = d(4) = 3;  d(2·1·1) = d(2) = 2;  d(2·1·2) = d(4) = 3;  d(2·2·1) = d(4) = 3;  d(2·2·2) = d(8) = 4. 

So the result is 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 20.

QUESTION:
Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output ""YES""(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print ""NO"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...

QUESTION:
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
Array of integers is unimodal, if:

  it is strictly increasing in the beginning;  after that it is constant;  after that it is strictly decreasing. 

The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.

For example, the following three arrays are unimodal: [5, 7, 11, 11, 2, 1], [4, 4, 2], [7], but the following three are not unimodal: [5, 5, 6, 6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 5, 6].

Write a program that checks if an array is unimodal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1 000) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if the given array is unimodal. Otherwise, print ""NO"".

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----

In the first example the array is unimodal, because it is strictly increasing in the beginning (from position 1 to position 2, inclusively), that it is constant (from position 2 to position 4, inclusively) and then it is strictly decreasing (from position 4 to position 6, inclusively).

QUESTION:
At first, let's define function $f(x)$ as follows: $$ \begin{matrix} f(x) & = & \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{x}{2} & \mbox{if } x \text{ is even} \\ x - 1 & \mbox{otherwise } \end{matrix} \right. \end{matrix} $$

We can see that if we choose some value $v$ and will apply function $f$ to it, then apply $f$ to $f(v)$, and so on, we'll eventually get $1$. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as $path(v)$. For example, $path(1) = [1]$, $path(15) = [15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1]$, $path(32) = [32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]$.

Let's write all lists $path(x)$ for every $x$ from $1$ to $n$. The question is next: what is the maximum value $y$ such that $y$ is contained in at least $k$ different lists $path(x)$?

Formally speaking, you need to find maximum $y$ such that $\left| \{ x ~|~ 1 \le x \le n, y \in path(x) \} \right| \ge k$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 10^{18}$).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the maximum value that is contained in at least $k$ paths.


-----Examples-----
Input
11 3

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
4

Input
20 20

Output
1

Input
14 5

Output
6

Input
1000000 100

Output
31248



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $5$, since $5$ occurs in $path(5)$, $path(10)$ and $path(11)$.

In the second example, the answer is $4$, since $4$ occurs in $path(4)$, $path(5)$, $path(8)$, $path(9)$, $path(10)$ and $path(11)$.

In the third example $n = k$, so the answer is $1$, since $1$ is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from $1$ to $20$.

QUESTION:
Consider a billiard table of rectangular size $n \times m$ with four pockets. Let's introduce a coordinate system with the origin at the lower left corner (see the picture).  [Image] 

There is one ball at the point $(x, y)$ currently. Max comes to the table and strikes the ball. The ball starts moving along a line that is parallel to one of the axes or that makes a $45^{\circ}$ angle with them. We will assume that:   the angles between the directions of the ball before and after a collision with a side are equal,  the ball moves indefinitely long, it only stops when it falls into a pocket,  the ball can be considered as a point, it falls into a pocket if and only if its coordinates coincide with one of the pockets,  initially the ball is not in a pocket. 

Note that the ball can move along some side, in this case the ball will just fall into the pocket at the end of the side.

Your task is to determine whether the ball will fall into a pocket eventually, and if yes, which of the four pockets it will be.


-----Input-----

The only line contains $6$ integers $n$, $m$, $x$, $y$, $v_x$, $v_y$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9$, $0 \leq x \leq n$; $0 \leq y \leq m$; $-1 \leq v_x, v_y \leq 1$; $(v_x, v_y) \neq (0, 0)$) — the width of the table, the length of the table, the $x$-coordinate of the initial position of the ball, the $y$-coordinate of the initial position of the ball, the $x$-component of its initial speed and the $y$-component of its initial speed, respectively. It is guaranteed that the ball is not initially in a pocket.


-----Output-----

Print the coordinates of the pocket the ball will fall into, or $-1$ if the ball will move indefinitely.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 2 2 -1 1

Output
0 0
Input
4 4 2 0 1 1

Output
-1
Input
10 10 10 1 -1 0

Output
-1


-----Note-----

The first sample:  [Image] 

The second sample:  [Image] 

In the third sample the ball will never change its $y$ coordinate, so the ball will never fall into a pocket.

QUESTION:
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print ""YES"" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print ""NO"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output

-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

QUESTION:
Masha really loves algebra. On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.

You are given geometric progression b defined by two integers b_1 and q. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., where for each i > 1 the respective term satisfies the condition b_{i} = b_{i} - 1·q, where q is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both b_1 and q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha m ""bad"" integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, and an integer l.

Masha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |b_{i}| ≤ l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the ""bad"" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.

But the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print ""inf"" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains four integers b_1, q, l, m (-10^9 ≤ b_1, q ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of ""bad"" integers, respectively.

The second line contains m distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (-10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — numbers that will never be written on the board.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or ""inf"" (without quotes) otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2 30 4
6 14 25 48

Output
3
Input
123 1 2143435 4
123 11 -5453 141245

Output
0
Input
123 1 2143435 4
54343 -13 6 124

Output
inf


-----Note-----

In the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3, 12, 24. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a ""bad"" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed l by absolute value.

In the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a ""bad"" integer.

In the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123.

QUESTION:
Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are ""dead"", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as ""the game is good for the imagination and attention"".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character ""."" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character ""w"" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters ""+"" (the ""plus"" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as ""w"". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.

QUESTION:
Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.

QUESTION:
JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.

The second line contains a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10\,000$), where $a_i$ equals to the number of problems, which Polycarp will solve on the $i$-th day.


-----Output-----

Print the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
You stumbled upon a new kind of chess puzzles. The chessboard you are given is not necesserily $8 \times 8$, but it still is $N \times N$. Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from $1$ to $N^2$ and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The $j$-th square in the $i$-th row has a number $A_{ij}$ written on it.

In your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number $1$ (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square $2$ (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square $3$ and so on until you reach square $N^2$. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.

A knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.

You want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal. Among all the paths to have the same number of steps you want to choose the one with the lowest number of piece replacements.

What is the path you should take to satisfy all conditions?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($3 \le N \le 10$) — the size of the chessboard.

Each of the next $N$ lines contains $N$ integers $A_{i1}, A_{i2}, \dots, A_{iN}$ ($1 \le A_{ij} \le N^2$) — the numbers written on the squares of the $i$-th row of the board.

It is guaranteed that all $A_{ij}$ are pairwise distinct.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain two integers — the number of steps in the best answer and the number of replacement moves in it.


-----Example-----
Input
3
1 9 3
8 6 7
4 2 5

Output
12 1



-----Note-----

Here are the steps for the first example (the starting piece is a knight):  Move to $(3, 2)$  Move to $(1, 3)$  Move to $(3, 2)$  Replace the knight with a rook  Move to $(3, 1)$  Move to $(3, 3)$  Move to $(3, 2)$  Move to $(2, 2)$  Move to $(2, 3)$  Move to $(2, 1)$  Move to $(1, 1)$  Move to $(1, 2)$

QUESTION:
Есть n-подъездный дом, в каждом подъезде по m этажей, и на каждом этаже каждого подъезда ровно k квартир. Таким образом, в доме всего n·m·k квартир. Они пронумерованы естественным образом от 1 до n·m·k, то есть первая квартира на первом этаже в первом подъезде имеет номер 1, первая квартира на втором этаже первого подъезда имеет номер k + 1 и так далее. Особенность этого дома состоит в том, что он круглый. То есть если обходить его по часовой стрелке, то после подъезда номер 1 следует подъезд номер 2, затем подъезд номер 3 и так далее до подъезда номер n. После подъезда номер n снова идёт подъезд номер 1.

Эдвард живёт в квартире номер a, а Наташа — в квартире номер b. Переход на 1 этаж вверх или вниз по лестнице занимает 5 секунд, переход от двери подъезда к двери соседнего подъезда — 15 секунд, а переход в пределах одного этажа одного подъезда происходит мгновенно. Также в каждом подъезде дома есть лифт. Он устроен следующим образом: он всегда приезжает ровно через 10 секунд после вызова, а чтобы переместить пассажира на один этаж вверх или вниз, лифт тратит ровно 1 секунду. Посадка и высадка происходят мгновенно.

Помогите Эдварду найти минимальное время, за которое он сможет добраться до квартиры Наташи. Считайте, что Эдвард может выйти из подъезда только с первого этажа соответствующего подъезда (это происходит мгновенно). Если Эдвард стоит перед дверью какого-то подъезда, он может зайти в него и сразу окажется на первом этаже этого подъезда (это также происходит мгновенно). Эдвард может выбирать, в каком направлении идти вокруг дома.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке входных данных следуют три числа n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) — количество подъездов в доме, количество этажей в каждом подъезде и количество квартир на каждом этаже каждого подъезда соответственно.

Во второй строке входных данных записаны два числа a и b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) — номера квартир, в которых живут Эдвард и Наташа, соответственно. Гарантируется, что эти номера различны. 


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите единственное целое число — минимальное время (в секундах), за которое Эдвард сможет добраться от своей квартиры до квартиры Наташи.


-----Примеры-----
Входные данные
4 10 5
200 6

Выходные данные
39

Входные данные
3 1 5
7 2

Выходные данные
15



-----Примечание-----

В первом тестовом примере Эдвард находится в 4 подъезде на 10 этаже, а Наташа находится в 1 подъезде на 2 этаже. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.

Во втором тестовом примере Эдвард живёт в подъезде 2 на этаже 1, а Наташа находится в подъезде 1 на этаже 1. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно просто обойти дом по часовой стрелке до подъезда 1, на это он потратит 15 секунд.

QUESTION:
You are given a string s consisting of |s| small english letters.

In one move you can replace any character of this string to the next character in alphabetical order (a will be replaced with b, s will be replaced with t, etc.). You cannot replace letter z with any other letter.

Your target is to make some number of moves (not necessary minimal) to get string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (english alphabet) as a subsequence. Subsequence of the string is the string that is obtained by deleting characters at some positions. You need to print the string that will be obtained from the given string and will be contain english alphabet as a subsequence or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The only one line of the input consisting of the string s consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small english letters.

QUESTION:
While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]

QUESTION:
Nick had received an awesome array of integers $a=[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ as a gift for his $5$ birthday from his mother. He was already going to explore its various properties but after unpacking he was disappointed a lot because the product $a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots a_n$ of its elements seemed to him not large enough.

He was ready to throw out the array, but his mother reassured him. She told him, that array would not be spoiled after the following operation: choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and do $a_i := -a_i - 1$.

For example, he can change array $[3, -1, -4, 1]$ to an array $[-4, -1, 3, 1]$ after applying this operation to elements with indices $i=1$ and $i=3$. 

Kolya had immediately understood that sometimes it's possible to increase the product of integers of the array a lot. Now he has decided that he wants to get an array with the maximal possible product of integers using only this operation with its elements (possibly zero, one or more times, as many as he wants), it is not forbidden to do this operation several times for the same index. 

Help Kolya and print the array with the maximal possible product of elements $a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots a_n$ which can be received using only this operation in some order.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$) — number of integers in the array.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($-10^{6} \leq a_i \leq 10^{6}$) — elements of the array


-----Output-----

Print $n$ numbers — elements of the array with the maximal possible product of elements which can be received using only this operation in some order from the given array.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

QUESTION:
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

QUESTION:
Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.

QUESTION:
You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

QUESTION:
The Bad Luck Island is inhabited by three kinds of species: r rocks, s scissors and p papers. At some moments of time two random individuals meet (all pairs of individuals can meet equiprobably), and if they belong to different species, then one individual kills the other one: a rock kills scissors, scissors kill paper, and paper kills a rock. Your task is to determine for each species what is the probability that this species will be the only one to inhabit this island after a long enough period of time.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers r, s and p (1 ≤ r, s, p ≤ 100) — the original number of individuals in the species of rock, scissors and paper, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print three space-separated real numbers: the probabilities, at which the rocks, the scissors and the paper will be the only surviving species, respectively. The answer will be considered correct if the relative or absolute error of each number doesn't exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
There is a grass field that stretches infinitely.
In this field, there is a negligibly small cow. Let (x, y) denote the point that is x\ \mathrm{cm} south and y\ \mathrm{cm} east of the point where the cow stands now. The cow itself is standing at (0, 0).
There are also N north-south lines and M east-west lines drawn on the field. The i-th north-south line is the segment connecting the points (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the j-th east-west line is the segment connecting the points (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).
What is the area of the region the cow can reach when it can move around as long as it does not cross the segments (including the endpoints)? If this area is infinite, print INF instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers between -10^9 and 10^9  (inclusive).
 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 1000
 - A_i < B_i\ (1 \leq i \leq N)
 - E_j < F_j\ (1 \leq j \leq M)
 - The point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments.

QUESTION:
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

 [Image] 

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single ""YES"" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single ""NO"" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

QUESTION:
You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of one-dimensional segments numbered 1 through n. Your task is to find two distinct indices i and j such that segment a_{i} lies within segment a_{j}.

Segment [l_1, r_1] lies within segment [l_2, r_2] iff l_1 ≥ l_2 and r_1 ≤ r_2.

Print indices i and j. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no answer exists, print -1 -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of segments.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the i-th segment.

QUESTION:
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: ""==="" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

QUESTION:
Ilya is an experienced player in tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field. He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. 

The rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).


-----Input-----

The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.

Each of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.


-----Output-----

Print single line: ""YES"" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
xx..
.oo.
x...
oox.

Output
YES

Input
x.ox
ox..
x.o.
oo.x

Output
NO

Input
x..x
..oo
o...
x.xo

Output
YES

Input
o.x.
o...
.x..
ooxx

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.

In the second example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.

In the third example Ilya could have won by placing X in the last row between two existing Xs.

In the fourth example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.

QUESTION:
Vasya has an array a consisting of positive integer numbers. Vasya wants to divide this array into two non-empty consecutive parts (the prefix and the suffix) so that the sum of all elements in the first part equals to the sum of elements in the second part. It is not always possible, so Vasya will move some element before dividing the array (Vasya will erase some element and insert it into an arbitrary position).

Inserting an element in the same position he was erased from is also considered moving.

Can Vasya divide the array after choosing the right element to move and its new position?


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the size of the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2... a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print YES if Vasya can divide the array after moving one element. Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 3 2

Output
YES

Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
NO

Input
5
2 2 3 4 5

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya can move the second element to the end of the array.

In the second example no move can make the division possible.

In the third example Vasya can move the fourth element by one position to the left.

QUESTION:
A few years ago, Hitagi encountered a giant crab, who stole the whole of her body weight. Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.

To get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.

Hitagi's sequence a has a length of n. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence b, whose length k equals the number of lost elements in a (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in a with an element from b so that each element in b should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in a and b more than once in total.

If the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is possible to replace each zero in a with an integer from b so that each integer from b is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence is not increasing.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the lengths of sequence a and b respectively.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 200) — Hitagi's broken sequence with exactly k zero elements.

The third line contains k space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 200) — the elements to fill into Hitagi's sequence.

Input guarantees that apart from 0, no integer occurs in a and b more than once in total.


-----Output-----

Output ""Yes"" if it's possible to replace zeros in a with elements in b and make the resulting sequence not increasing, and ""No"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
11 0 0 14
5 4

Output
Yes

0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample:   Sequence a is 11, 0, 0, 14.  Two of the elements are lost, and the candidates in b are 5 and 4.  There are two possible resulting sequences: 11, 5, 4, 14 and 11, 4, 5, 14, both of which fulfill the requirements. Thus the answer is ""Yes"". 

In the second sample, the only possible resulting sequence is 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, which is an increasing sequence and therefore invalid.

QUESTION:
The Duck song

For simplicity, we'll assume that there are only three types of grapes: green grapes, purple grapes and black grapes.

Andrew, Dmitry and Michal are all grapes' lovers, however their preferences of grapes are different. To make all of them happy, the following should happen: Andrew, Dmitry and Michal should eat at least $x$, $y$ and $z$ grapes, respectively. Andrew has an extreme affinity for green grapes, thus he will eat green grapes and green grapes only. On the other hand, Dmitry is not a fan of black grapes — any types of grapes except black would do for him. In other words, Dmitry can eat green and purple grapes. Michal has a common taste — he enjoys grapes in general and will be pleased with any types of grapes, as long as the quantity is sufficient.

Knowing that his friends are so fond of grapes, Aki decided to host a grape party with them. He has prepared a box with $a$ green grapes, $b$ purple grapes and $c$ black grapes.

However, Aki isn't sure if the box he prepared contains enough grapes to make everyone happy. Can you please find out whether it's possible to distribute grapes so that everyone is happy or Aki has to buy some more grapes?

It is not required to distribute all the grapes, so it's possible that some of them will remain unused.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($1 \le x, y, z \le 10^5$) — the number of grapes Andrew, Dmitry and Michal want to eat.

The second line contains three integers $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10^5$) — the number of green, purple and black grapes in the box.


-----Output-----

If there is a grape distribution that allows everyone to be happy, print ""YES"", otherwise print ""NO"".


-----Examples-----
Input
1 6 2
4 3 3

Output
YES

Input
5 1 1
4 3 2

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, there is only one possible distribution:

Andrew should take $1$ green grape, Dmitry should take $3$ remaining green grapes and $3$ purple grapes, and Michal will take $2$ out of $3$ available black grapes.

In the second test, there is no possible distribution, since Andrew is not be able to eat enough green grapes. :(

QUESTION:
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print ""YES"" if an accident is possible, and ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0

0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

QUESTION:
While swimming at the beach, Mike has accidentally dropped his cellphone into the water. There was no worry as he bought a cheap replacement phone with an old-fashioned keyboard. The keyboard has only ten digital equal-sized keys, located in the following way: [Image] 

Together with his old phone, he lost all his contacts and now he can only remember the way his fingers moved when he put some number in. One can formally consider finger movements as a sequence of vectors connecting centers of keys pressed consecutively to put in a number. For example, the finger movements for number ""586"" are the same as finger movements for number ""253"": [Image]  [Image] 

Mike has already put in a number by his ""finger memory"" and started calling it, so he is now worrying, can he be sure that he is calling the correct number? In other words, is there any other number, that has the same finger movements?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) — the number of digits in the phone number that Mike put in.

The second line contains the string consisting of n digits (characters from '0' to '9') representing the number that Mike put in.


-----Output-----

If there is no other phone number with the same finger movements and Mike can be sure he is calling the correct number, print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the only line.

Otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes) in the first line.

QUESTION:
Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.

QUESTION:
It is a balmy spring afternoon, and Farmer John's n cows are ruminating about link-cut cacti in their stalls. The cows, labeled 1 through n, are arranged so that the i-th cow occupies the i-th stall from the left. However, Elsie, after realizing that she will forever live in the shadows beyond Bessie's limelight, has formed the Mischievous Mess Makers and is plotting to disrupt this beautiful pastoral rhythm. While Farmer John takes his k minute long nap, Elsie and the Mess Makers plan to repeatedly choose two distinct stalls and swap the cows occupying those stalls, making no more than one swap each minute.

Being the meticulous pranksters that they are, the Mischievous Mess Makers would like to know the maximum messiness attainable in the k minutes that they have. We denote as p_{i} the label of the cow in the i-th stall. The messiness of an arrangement of cows is defined as the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and p_{i} > p_{j}.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100 000) — the number of cows and the length of Farmer John's nap, respectively.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the maximum messiness that the Mischievous Mess Makers can achieve by performing no more than k swaps. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2

Output
10

Input
1 10

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the Mischievous Mess Makers can swap the cows in the stalls 1 and 5 during the first minute, then the cows in stalls 2 and 4 during the second minute. This reverses the arrangement of cows, giving us a total messiness of 10.

In the second sample, there is only one cow, so the maximum possible messiness is 0.

QUESTION:
Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print ""-1"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.

QUESTION:
Polycarp has a checkered sheet of paper of size n × m. Polycarp painted some of cells with black, the others remained white. Inspired by Malevich's ""Black Square"", Polycarp wants to paint minimum possible number of white cells with black so that all black cells form a square.

You are to determine the minimum possible number of cells needed to be painted black so that the black cells form a black square with sides parallel to the painting's sides. All the cells that do not belong to the square should be white. The square's side should have positive length.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the sheet.

The next n lines contain m letters 'B' or 'W' each — the description of initial cells' colors. If a letter is 'B', then the corresponding cell is painted black, otherwise it is painted white.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of cells needed to be painted black so that the black cells form a black square with sides parallel to the painting's sides. All the cells that do not belong to the square should be white. If it is impossible, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 4

WWWB
WWBB
WWWW

Output

Input

Output

Input

WWW
WWW

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example it is needed to paint 5 cells — (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3) and (4, 2). Then there will be a square with side equal to three, and the upper left corner in (2, 2).

In the second example all the cells are painted black and form a rectangle, so it's impossible to get a square.

In the third example all cells are colored white, so it's sufficient to color any cell black.

QUESTION:
There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output ""Yes"", otherwise output ""No"" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.

QUESTION:
Students Vasya and Petya are studying at the BSU (Byteland State University). At one of the breaks they decided to order a pizza. In this problem pizza is a circle of some radius. The pizza was delivered already cut into n pieces. The i-th piece is a sector of angle equal to a_{i}. Vasya and Petya want to divide all pieces of pizza into two continuous sectors in such way that the difference between angles of these sectors is minimal. Sector angle is sum of angles of all pieces in it. Pay attention, that one of sectors can be empty.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 360)  — the number of pieces into which the delivered pizza was cut.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 360)  — the angles of the sectors into which the pizza was cut. The sum of all a_{i} is 360.


-----Output-----

Print one integer  — the minimal difference between angles of sectors that will go to Vasya and Petya.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
90 90 90 90

Output
0

Input
3

Output
40

Input
1
360

Output
360

Input
4
170 30 150 10

Output
0



-----Note-----

In first sample Vasya can take 1 and 2 pieces, Petya can take 3 and 4 pieces. Then the answer is |(90 + 90) - (90 + 90)| = 0.

In third sample there is only one piece of pizza that can be taken by only one from Vasya and Petya. So the answer is |360 - 0| = 360.

In fourth sample Vasya can take 1 and 4 pieces, then Petya will take 2 and 3 pieces. So the answer is |(170 + 10) - (30 + 150)| = 0.

Picture explaning fourth sample:

[Image]

Both red and green sectors consist of two adjacent pieces of pizza. So Vasya can take green sector, then Petya will take red sector.

QUESTION:
Alice got many presents these days. So she decided to pack them into boxes and send them to her friends.

There are $n$ kinds of presents. Presents of one kind are identical (i.e. there is no way to distinguish two gifts of the same kind). Presents of different kinds are different (i.e. that is, two gifts of different kinds are distinguishable). The number of presents of each kind, that Alice has is very big, so we can consider Alice has an infinite number of gifts of each kind.

Also, there are $m$ boxes. All of them are for different people, so they are pairwise distinct (consider that the names of $m$ friends are written on the boxes). For example, putting the first kind of present into the first box but not into the second box, is different from putting the first kind of present into the second box but not into the first box.

Alice wants to pack presents with the following rules:  She won't pack more than one present of each kind into the same box, so each box should contain presents of different kinds (i.e. each box contains a subset of $n$ kinds, empty boxes are allowed);  For each kind at least one present should be packed into some box. 

Now Alice wants to know how many different ways to pack the presents exists. Please, help her and calculate this number. Since the answer can be huge, output it by modulo $10^9+7$.

See examples and their notes for clarification.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$, separated by spaces ($1 \leq n,m \leq 10^9$) — the number of kinds of presents and the number of boxes that Alice has.


-----Output-----

Print one integer  — the number of ways to pack the presents with Alice's rules, calculated by modulo $10^9+7$


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
7
Input
2 2

Output
9


-----Note-----

In the first example, there are seven ways to pack presents:

$\{1\}\{\}\{\}$

$\{\}\{1\}\{\}$

$\{\}\{\}\{1\}$

$\{1\}\{1\}\{\}$

$\{\}\{1\}\{1\}$

$\{1\}\{\}\{1\}$

$\{1\}\{1\}\{1\}$

In the second example there are nine ways to pack presents:

$\{\}\{1,2\}$

$\{1\}\{2\}$

$\{1\}\{1,2\}$

$\{2\}\{1\}$

$\{2\}\{1,2\}$

$\{1,2\}\{\}$

$\{1,2\}\{1\}$

$\{1,2\}\{2\}$

$\{1,2\}\{1,2\}$

For example, the way $\{2\}\{2\}$ is wrong, because presents of the first kind should be used in the least one box.

QUESTION:
Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle.


-----Output-----

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

QUESTION:
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print ""Yes"", if all the remainders are distinct, and ""No"" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).

4 4

Output
No

5 3

Yes

QUESTION:
You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.

QUESTION:
Kuro has recently won the ""Most intelligent cat ever"" contest. The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.

Kuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.

The paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.

The rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \to 0 \to 1 \to 0]$, $[0 \to 1 \to 0 \to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.

But Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for ""even"" and $p = 1$ stands for ""odd"". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.

It seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50$, $0 \leq p \leq 1$) — the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.

The second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \leq c_{i} \leq 1$) — the colors of the pieces.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 1
-1 0 1

Output
6
Input
2 1
1 0

Output
1
Input
1 1
-1

Output
2


-----Note-----

In the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below. The scores are $3, 3, 5$ for the first row and $5, 3, 3$ for the second row, both from left to right.

QUESTION:
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output

Input
4 4 4 4

Output

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

QUESTION:
You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.

QUESTION:
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the $(Ox)$ axis.

On this street, there are $n$ antennas, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th antenna lies on the position $x_i$ and has an initial scope of $s_i$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$.

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $1$, this operation costs $1$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $[1; m]$, even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 80$ and $n \le m \le 100\ 000$).

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le m$ and $0 \le s_i \le m$).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values $x_i$ are pairwise distinct).


-----Output-----

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 595
43 2
300 4
554 10

Output
281

Input

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  Increase the scope of the first antenna by $40$, so that it becomes $2 + 40 = 42$. This antenna will cover interval $[43 - 42; 43 + 42]$ which is $[1; 85]$  Increase the scope of the second antenna by $210$, so that it becomes $4 + 210 = 214$. This antenna will cover interval $[300 - 214; 300 + 214]$, which is $[86; 514]$  Increase the scope of the third antenna by $31$, so that it becomes $10 + 31 = 41$. This antenna will cover interval $[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$, which is $[513; 595]$ 

Total cost is $40 + 210 + 31 = 281$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $1$ to $595$ covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions $513$ and $514$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $[0; 2]$ so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position $1$; positions $0$ and $2$ are covered, but it's not important.

QUESTION:
You have a set of items, each having some integer weight not greater than $8$. You denote that a subset of items is good if total weight of items in the subset does not exceed $W$.

You want to calculate the maximum possible weight of a good subset of items. Note that you have to consider the empty set and the original set when calculating the answer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $W$ ($0 \le W \le 10^{18}$) — the maximum total weight of a good subset.

The second line denotes the set of items you have. It contains $8$ integers $cnt_1$, $cnt_2$, ..., $cnt_8$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^{16}$), where $cnt_i$ is the number of items having weight $i$ in the set.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum possible weight of a good subset of items.

QUESTION:
A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input

Output

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.

QUESTION:
Someone gave Alyona an array containing n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. In one operation, Alyona can choose any element of the array and decrease it, i.e. replace with any positive integer that is smaller than the current one. Alyona can repeat this operation as many times as she wants. In particular, she may not apply any operation to the array at all.

Formally, after applying some operations Alyona will get an array of n positive integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} such that 1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ a_{i} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Your task is to determine the maximum possible value of mex of this array.

Mex of an array in this problem is the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in this array. For example, mex of the array containing 1, 3 and 4 is equal to 2, while mex of the array containing 2, 3 and 2 is equal to 1.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of elements in the Alyona's array.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print one positive integer — the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 3 3 3 6

Output
5

Input
2
2 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample case if one will decrease the second element value to 2 and the fifth element value to 4 then the mex value of resulting array 1 2 3 3 4 will be equal to 5.

To reach the answer to the second sample case one must not decrease any of the array elements.

QUESTION:
Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print ""YES"", otherwise print ""NO"" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.

QUESTION:
Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network. 

But yesterday, he came to see ""her"" in the real world and found out ""she"" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.


-----Output-----

If it is a female by our hero's method, print ""CHAT WITH HER!"" (without the quotes), otherwise, print ""IGNORE HIM!"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
wjmzbmr

Output
CHAT WITH HER!

Input
xiaodao

Output
IGNORE HIM!

Input
sevenkplus

Output
CHAT WITH HER!



-----Note-----

For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in ""wjmzbmr"". These characters are: ""w"", ""j"", ""m"", ""z"", ""b"", ""r"". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print ""CHAT WITH HER!"".

QUESTION:
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

QUESTION:
R3D3 spent some time on an internship in MDCS. After earning enough money, he decided to go on a holiday somewhere far, far away. He enjoyed suntanning, drinking alcohol-free cocktails and going to concerts of popular local bands. While listening to ""The White Buttons"" and their hit song ""Dacan the Baker"", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.

There are n letters in R3D3’s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter’s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence. Since the Intergalactic Space Communications Service has lately introduced a tax for invented alphabets, R3D3 must pay a certain amount of money for each bit in his alphabet’s code (check the sample test for clarifications). He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help.

Given the costs c_0 and c_1 for each '0' and '1' in R3D3’s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains three integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), c_0 and c_1 (0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8) — the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively. 


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.


-----Example-----
Input
4 1 2

Output
12



-----Note-----

There are 4 letters in the alphabet. The optimal encoding is ""00"", ""01"", ""10"", ""11"". There are 4 zeroes and 4 ones used, so the total cost is 4·1 + 4·2 = 12.

QUESTION:
The circle line of the Roflanpolis subway has $n$ stations.

There are two parallel routes in the subway. The first one visits stations in order $1 \to 2 \to \ldots \to n \to 1 \to 2 \to \ldots$ (so the next stop after station $x$ is equal to $(x+1)$ if $x < n$ and $1$ otherwise). The second route visits stations in order $n \to (n-1) \to \ldots \to 1 \to n \to (n-1) \to \ldots$ (so the next stop after station $x$ is equal to $(x-1)$ if $x>1$ and $n$ otherwise). All trains depart their stations simultaneously, and it takes exactly $1$ minute to arrive at the next station.

Two toads live in this city, their names are Daniel and Vlad.

Daniel is currently in a train of the first route at station $a$ and will exit the subway when his train reaches station $x$.

Coincidentally, Vlad is currently in a train of the second route at station $b$ and he will exit the subway when his train reaches station $y$.

Surprisingly, all numbers $a,x,b,y$ are distinct.

Toad Ilya asks you to check if Daniel and Vlad will ever be at the same station at the same time during their journey. In other words, check if there is a moment when their trains stop at the same station. Note that this includes the moments when Daniel or Vlad enter or leave the subway.


-----Input-----

The first line contains five space-separated integers $n$, $a$, $x$, $b$, $y$ ($4 \leq n \leq 100$, $1 \leq a, x, b, y \leq n$, all numbers among $a$, $x$, $b$, $y$ are distinct) — the number of stations in Roflanpolis, Daniel's start station, Daniel's finish station, Vlad's start station and Vlad's finish station, respectively.


-----Output-----

Output ""YES"" if there is a time moment when Vlad and Daniel are at the same station, and ""NO"" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 1 4 3 2

Output
YES

Input
10 2 1 9 10

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, Daniel and Vlad start at the stations $(1, 3)$. One minute later they are at stations $(2, 2)$. They are at the same station at this moment. Note that Vlad leaves the subway right after that.

Consider the second example, let's look at the stations Vlad and Daniel are at. They are:   initially $(2, 9)$,  after $1$ minute $(3, 8)$,  after $2$ minutes $(4, 7)$,  after $3$ minutes $(5, 6)$,  after $4$ minutes $(6, 5)$,  after $5$ minutes $(7, 4)$,  after $6$ minutes $(8, 3)$,  after $7$ minutes $(9, 2)$,  after $8$ minutes $(10, 1)$,  after $9$ minutes $(1, 10)$. 

After that, they both leave the subway because they are at their finish stations, so there is no moment when they both are at the same station.

QUESTION:
Unlucky year in Berland is such a year that its number n can be represented as n = x^{a} + y^{b}, where a and b are non-negative integer numbers. 

For example, if x = 2 and y = 3 then the years 4 and 17 are unlucky (4 = 2^0 + 3^1, 17 = 2^3 + 3^2 = 2^4 + 3^0) and year 18 isn't unlucky as there is no such representation for it.

Such interval of years that there are no unlucky years in it is called The Golden Age.

You should write a program which will find maximum length of The Golden Age which starts no earlier than the year l and ends no later than the year r. If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then the answer is 0.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integer numbers x, y, l and r (2 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print the maximum length of The Golden Age within the interval [l, r].

If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 3 1 10

Output
1

Input
3 5 10 22

Output
8

Input
2 3 3 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the unlucky years are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10. So maximum length of The Golden Age is achived in the intervals [1, 1], [6, 6] and [8, 8].

In the second example the longest Golden Age is the interval [15, 22].

QUESTION:
Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n ≥ 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.

As mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_{k} = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition n_{i} ≥ 2 should hold for all i from 1 to k.

Ostap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the total year income of mr. Funt.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — minimum possible number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay as a tax.

The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: ""hellno"", ""hackcerrs"" and ""backtothefutttture"";  the following words don't have typos: ""helllllooooo"", ""tobeornottobe"" and ""oooooo"". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Output
hell no

QUESTION:
Anton is playing a very interesting computer game, but now he is stuck at one of the levels. To pass to the next level he has to prepare n potions.

Anton has a special kettle, that can prepare one potions in x seconds. Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are m spells of this type, the i-th of them costs b_{i} manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to a_{i} instead of x.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are k such spells, the i-th of them costs d_{i} manapoints and instantly create c_{i} potions. 

Anton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed s. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.

Anton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least n potions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.

The second line of the input contains two integers x and s (2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9) — the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.

The third line contains m integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) — the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the i-th spell of the first type is used.

The fourth line contains m integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints to use the i-th spell of the first type.

There are k integers c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) in the fifth line — the number of potions that will be immediately created if the i-th spell of the second type is used. It's guaranteed that c_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. c_{i} ≤ c_{j} if i < j.

The sixth line contains k integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints required to use the i-th spell of the second type. It's guaranteed that d_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. d_{i} ≤ d_{j} if i < j.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum time one has to spent in order to prepare n potions.


-----Examples-----
Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
20 10 40
4 15
10 80

Output
20

Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
200 100 400
4 15
100 800

Output
200



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the optimum answer is to use the second spell of the first type that costs 10 manapoints. Thus, the preparation time of each potion changes to 4 seconds. Also, Anton should use the second spell of the second type to instantly prepare 15 potions spending 80 manapoints. The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4·5 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).

In the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20·10 = 200.

QUESTION:
Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.

Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

QUESTION:
Recall that a binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose nodes each store a key and each have at most two distinguished subtrees, left and right. The key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree, and less than any key stored in the right subtree.

The depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In particular, the depth of the root is $0$.

Let's call a binary search tree perfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices.

Let's call a binary search tree with integer keys striped if both of the following conditions are satisfied for every vertex $v$:   If $v$ has a left subtree whose root is $u$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is different from the parity of the key of $u$.  If $v$ has a right subtree whose root is $w$, then the parity of the key of $v$ is the same as the parity of the key of $w$. 

You are given a single integer $n$. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices that have distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive. Output this number modulo $998\,244\,353$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), denoting the required number of vertices.


-----Output-----

Output the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices and distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, modulo $998\,244\,353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, this is the only tree that satisfies the conditions: $\left. \begin{array}{l}{\text{perfectly balanced}} \\{\text{striped}} \\{\text{binary search tree}} \end{array} \right.$

In the second example, here are various trees that don't satisfy some condition: [Image]

QUESTION:
You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.

QUESTION:
Today, Osama gave Fadi an integer $X$, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of $max(a, b)$ such that $LCM(a, b)$ equals $X$. Both $a$ and $b$ should be positive integers.

$LCM(a, b)$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$. For example, $LCM(6, 8) = 24$, $LCM(4, 12) = 12$, $LCM(2, 3) = 6$.

Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains an integer $X$ ($1 \le X \le 10^{12}$).


-----Output-----

Print two positive integers, $a$ and $b$, such that the value of $max(a, b)$ is minimum possible and $LCM(a, b)$ equals $X$. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.

QUESTION:
Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has.

QUESTION:
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print ""YES"". Otherwise print ""NO"".

QUESTION:
You are given an array of n elements, you must make it a co-prime array in as few moves as possible.

In each move you can insert any positive integral number you want not greater than 10^9 in any place in the array.

An array is co-prime if any two adjacent numbers of it are co-prime.

In the number theory, two integers a and b are said to be co-prime if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the given array.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.


-----Output-----

Print integer k on the first line — the least number of elements needed to add to the array a to make it co-prime.

The second line should contain n + k integers a_{j} — the elements of the array a after adding k elements to it. Note that the new array should be co-prime, so any two adjacent values should be co-prime. Also the new array should be got from the original array a by adding k elements to it.

If there are multiple answers you can print any one of them.

QUESTION:
We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----

QUESTION:
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
39

Output
4
5 3 
Input
1

Output
0

Input
7

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

QUESTION:
Luba thinks about watering her garden. The garden can be represented as a segment of length k. Luba has got n buckets, the i-th bucket allows her to water some continuous subsegment of garden of length exactly a_{i} each hour. Luba can't water any parts of the garden that were already watered, also she can't water the ground outside the garden.

Luba has to choose one of the buckets in order to water the garden as fast as possible (as mentioned above, each hour she will water some continuous subsegment of length a_{i} if she chooses the i-th bucket). Help her to determine the minimum number of hours she has to spend watering the garden. It is guaranteed that Luba can always choose a bucket so it is possible water the garden.

See the examples for better understanding.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of buckets and the length of the garden, respectively.

The second line of input contains n integer numbers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the length of the segment that can be watered by the i-th bucket in one hour.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one bucket such that it is possible to water the garden in integer number of hours using only this bucket.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of hours required to water the garden.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 6
2 3 5

Output
2

Input
6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first test the best option is to choose the bucket that allows to water the segment of length 3. We can't choose the bucket that allows to water the segment of length 5 because then we can't water the whole garden.

In the second test we can choose only the bucket that allows us to water the segment of length 1.

QUESTION:
On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print ""NO"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.

Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer — as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.

Your task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).

The football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] 

In the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 — the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} — the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} — the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r — the radius of the ball. 

A goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.


-----Input-----

The first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 ≤ y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} ≤ 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2·r < y_2 - y_1).

It is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.


-----Output-----

If Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print ""-1"" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} — the abscissa of his point of aiming. 

If there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them. When checking the correctness of the answer, all comparisons are made with the permissible absolute error, equal to 10^{ - 8}. 

It is recommended to print as many characters after the decimal point as possible.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 10 13 10 3 1

Output
4.3750000000

Input
1 4 6 2 2 1

Output
-1

Input
3 10 15 17 9 2

Output
11.3333333333



-----Note-----

Note that in the first and third samples other correct values of abscissa x_{w} are also possible.

QUESTION:
Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! 

Every day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.

Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.

According to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as missed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation. 


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2 1

Output

Input
1 0 0

Output

Output

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. 

In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal.

In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.

QUESTION:
There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output
YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Input

Output

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.

QUESTION:
You are given two strings a and b. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string b in such a way that it becomes a subsequence of string a. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from b and make it empty.

Subsequence of string s is any such string that can be obtained by erasing zero or more characters (not necessarily consecutive) from string s.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 10^5 characters.


-----Output-----

On the first line output a subsequence of string a, obtained from b by erasing the minimum number of consecutive characters.

If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).


-----Examples-----
Input
hi
bob

Output
-

Input
abca
accepted

Output
ac

Input
abacaba
abcdcba

Output
abcba



-----Note-----

In the first example strings a and b don't share any symbols, so the longest string that you can get is empty.

In the second example ac is a subsequence of a, and at the same time you can obtain it by erasing consecutive symbols cepted from string b.

QUESTION:
Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to ""-"" (without quotes) or ""+"" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to ""-"" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to ""+"" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----

Output

Input

Output

Input

Output

Input

++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.

QUESTION:
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

QUESTION:
Two bored soldiers are playing card war. Their card deck consists of exactly n cards, numbered from 1 to n, all values are different. They divide cards between them in some manner, it's possible that they have different number of cards. Then they play a ""war""-like card game. 

The rules are following. On each turn a fight happens. Each of them picks card from the top of his stack and puts on the table. The one whose card value is bigger wins this fight and takes both cards from the table to the bottom of his stack. More precisely, he first takes his opponent's card and puts to the bottom of his stack, and then he puts his card to the bottom of his stack. If after some turn one of the player's stack becomes empty, he loses and the other one wins. 

You have to calculate how many fights will happen and who will win the game, or state that game won't end.


-----Input-----

First line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10), the number of cards.

Second line contains integer k_1 (1 ≤ k_1 ≤ n - 1), the number of the first soldier's cards. Then follow k_1 integers that are the values on the first soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.

Third line contains integer k_2 (k_1 + k_2 = n), the number of the second soldier's cards. Then follow k_2 integers that are the values on the second soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.

All card values are different.


-----Output-----

If somebody wins in this game, print 2 integers where the first one stands for the number of fights before end of game and the second one is 1 or 2 showing which player has won.

If the game won't end and will continue forever output  - 1.

QUESTION:
You have probably registered on Internet sites many times. And each time you should enter your invented password. Usually the registration form automatically checks the password's crypt resistance. If the user's password isn't complex enough, a message is displayed. Today your task is to implement such an automatic check.

Web-developers of the company Q assume that a password is complex enough, if it meets all of the following conditions:  the password length is at least 5 characters;  the password contains at least one large English letter;  the password contains at least one small English letter;  the password contains at least one digit. 

You are given a password. Please implement the automatic check of its complexity for company Q.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty sequence of characters (at most 100 characters). Each character is either a large English letter, or a small English letter, or a digit, or one of characters: ""!"", ""?"", ""."", "","", ""_"".


-----Output-----

If the password is complex enough, print message ""Correct"" (without the quotes), otherwise print message ""Too weak"" (without the quotes).

QUESTION:
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

QUESTION:
Imagine a city with n horizontal streets crossing m vertical streets, forming an (n - 1) × (m - 1) grid. In order to increase the traffic flow, mayor of the city has decided to make each street one way. This means in each horizontal street, the traffic moves only from west to east or only from east to west. Also, traffic moves only from north to south or only from south to north in each vertical street. It is possible to enter a horizontal street from a vertical street, or vice versa, at their intersection.

 [Image] 

The mayor has received some street direction patterns. Your task is to check whether it is possible to reach any junction from any other junction in the proposed street direction pattern.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integers n and m, (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 20), denoting the number of horizontal streets and the number of vertical streets.

The second line contains a string of length n, made of characters '<' and '>', denoting direction of each horizontal street. If the i-th character is equal to '<', the street is directed from east to west otherwise, the street is directed from west to east. Streets are listed in order from north to south.

The third line contains a string of length m, made of characters '^' and 'v', denoting direction of each vertical street. If the i-th character is equal to '^', the street is directed from south to north, otherwise the street is directed from north to south. Streets are listed in order from west to east.


-----Output-----

If the given pattern meets the mayor's criteria, print a single line containing ""YES"", otherwise print a single line containing ""NO"".


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
><>
v^v

Output
NO

Input
4 6
<><>
v^v^v^

Output
YES



-----Note-----

The figure above shows street directions in the second sample test case.

QUESTION:
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print ""NO"" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print ""YES"" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: (""->"") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions ""0"", ""1"" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

QUESTION:
You have two variables a and b. Consider the following sequence of actions performed with these variables: If a = 0 or b = 0, end the process. Otherwise, go to step 2; If a ≥ 2·b, then set the value of a to a - 2·b, and repeat step 1. Otherwise, go to step 3; If b ≥ 2·a, then set the value of b to b - 2·a, and repeat step 1. Otherwise, end the process.

Initially the values of a and b are positive integers, and so the process will be finite.

You have to determine the values of a and b after the process ends.

QUESTION:
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

QUESTION:
Andrey thinks he is truly a successful developer, but in reality he didn't know about the binary search algorithm until recently. After reading some literature Andrey understood that this algorithm allows to quickly find a certain number $x$ in an array. For an array $a$ indexed from zero, and an integer $x$ the pseudocode of the algorithm is as follows:

BinarySearch(a, x)
  left = 0
  right = a.size()
  while left < right
    middle = (left + right) / 2
    if a[middle] <= x then
      left = middle + 1
    else
      right = middle
  
  if left > 0 and a[left - 1] == x then
    return true
  else
    return false

Note that the elements of the array are indexed from zero, and the division is done in integers (rounding down).

Andrey read that the algorithm only works if the array is sorted. However, he found this statement untrue, because there certainly exist unsorted arrays for which the algorithm find $x$!

Andrey wants to write a letter to the book authors, but before doing that he must consider the permutations of size $n$ such that the algorithm finds $x$ in them. A permutation of size $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$ in arbitrary order.

Help Andrey and find the number of permutations of size $n$ which contain $x$ at position $pos$ and for which the given implementation of the binary search algorithm finds $x$ (returns true). As the result may be extremely large, print the remainder of its division by $10^9+7$.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains integers $n$, $x$ and $pos$ ($1 \le x \le n \le 1000$, $0 \le pos \le n - 1$) — the required length of the permutation, the number to search, and the required position of that number, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the remainder of the division of the number of valid permutations by $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 1 2

Output
6

Input
123 42 24

Output

QUESTION:
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words ""Hello, Andrey!"", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.

QUESTION:
Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to ""true up"". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from ""true up"" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from ""true up"" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from ""true up"" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.

QUESTION:
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print ""Yes"". Otherwise, print ""No"".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

QUESTION:
Amr doesn't like Maths as he finds it really boring, so he usually sleeps in Maths lectures. But one day the teacher suspected that Amr is sleeping and asked him a question to make sure he wasn't.

First he gave Amr two positive integers n and k. Then he asked Amr, how many integer numbers x > 0 exist such that:  Decimal representation of x (without leading zeroes) consists of exactly n digits;  There exists some integer y > 0 such that:   $y \operatorname{mod} k = 0$;  decimal representation of y is a suffix of decimal representation of x.  

As the answer to this question may be pretty huge the teacher asked Amr to output only its remainder modulo a number m.

Can you help Amr escape this embarrassing situation?


-----Input-----

Input consists of three integers n, k, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the required number modulo m.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1000

Output
4
Input
2 2 1000

Output
45
Input
5 3 1103

Output
590


-----Note-----

A suffix of a string S is a non-empty string that can be obtained by removing some number (possibly, zero) of first characters from S.

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

QUESTION:
Finished her homework, Nastya decided to play computer games. Passing levels one by one, Nastya eventually faced a problem. Her mission is to leave a room, where a lot of monsters live, as quickly as possible.

There are $n$ manholes in the room which are situated on one line, but, unfortunately, all the manholes are closed, and there is one stone on every manhole. There is exactly one coin under every manhole, and to win the game Nastya should pick all the coins. Initially Nastya stands near the $k$-th manhole from the left. She is thinking what to do.

In one turn, Nastya can do one of the following:   if there is at least one stone on the manhole Nastya stands near, throw exactly one stone from it onto any other manhole (yes, Nastya is strong).  go to a neighboring manhole;  if there are no stones on the manhole Nastya stays near, she can open it and pick the coin from it. After it she must close the manhole immediately (it doesn't require additional moves). 

 [Image] The figure shows the intermediate state of the game. At the current position Nastya can throw the stone to any other manhole or move left or right to the neighboring manholes. If she were near the leftmost manhole, she could open it (since there are no stones on it). 

Nastya can leave the room when she picks all the coins. Monsters are everywhere, so you need to compute the minimum number of moves Nastya has to make to pick all the coins.

Note one time more that Nastya can open a manhole only when there are no stones onto it.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers $n$ and $k$, separated by space ($2 \leq n \leq 5000$, $1 \leq k \leq n$) — the number of manholes and the index of manhole from the left, near which Nastya stays initially. Initially there is exactly one stone near each of the $n$ manholes. 


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — minimum number of moves which lead Nastya to pick all the coins.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2

Output
6

Input
4 2

Output
13

Input
5 1

Output
15



-----Note-----

Let's consider the example where $n = 2$, $k = 2$. Nastya should play as follows:

  At first she throws the stone from the second manhole to the first. Now there are two stones on the first manhole.  Then she opens the second manhole and pick the coin from it.  Then she goes to the first manhole, throws two stones by two moves to the second manhole and then opens the manhole and picks the coin from it. 

So, $6$ moves are required to win.

QUESTION:
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

QUESTION:
Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print ""NO"" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.

QUESTION:
Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

 [Image] A row in the airplane 

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print ""YES"" (without quotes). Otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input

4 4

Output

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

 [Image] 

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).

QUESTION:
Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.

QUESTION:
Карта звёздного неба представляет собой прямоугольное поле, состоящее из n строк по m символов в каждой строке. Каждый символ — это либо «.» (означает пустой участок неба), либо «*» (означает то, что в этом месте на небе есть звезда). 

Новое издание карты звёздного неба будет напечатано на квадратных листах, поэтому требуется найти минимально возможную сторону квадрата, в который могут поместиться все звезды. Границы искомого квадрата должны быть параллельны сторонам заданного прямоугольного поля.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке входных данных записаны два числа n и m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — количество строк и столбцов на карте звездного неба.

В следующих n строках задано по m символов. Каждый символ — это либо «.» (пустой участок неба), либо «*» (звезда).

Гарантируется, что на небе есть хотя бы одна звезда.


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите одно число — минимально возможную сторону квадрата, которым можно накрыть все звезды.

QUESTION:
A girl named Sonya is studying in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland. The teacher of computer science (Sonya's favorite subject!) invented a task for her.

Given an array $a$ of length $n$, consisting only of the numbers $0$ and $1$, and the number $k$. Exactly $k$ times the following happens:   Two numbers $i$ and $j$ are chosen equiprobable such that ($1 \leq i < j \leq n$).  The numbers in the $i$ and $j$ positions are swapped. 

Sonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the $a$ array will be sorted in non-decreasing order. She turned to you for help. Help Sonya solve this problem.

It can be shown that the desired probability is either $0$ or it can be represented as $\dfrac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q \not\equiv 0~\pmod {10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$) — the length of the array $a$ and the number of operations.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the description of the array $a$.


-----Output-----

If the desired probability is $0$, print $0$, otherwise print the value $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ $\pmod {10^9+7}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are defined above.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
0 1 0

Output
333333336
Input
5 1
1 1 1 0 0

Output
0
Input
6 4
1 0 0 1 1 0

Output
968493834


-----Note-----

In the first example, all possible variants of the final array $a$, after applying exactly two operations: $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$. Therefore, the answer is $\dfrac{3}{9}=\dfrac{1}{3}$.

In the second example, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order after one operation, therefore the answer is $0$.

QUESTION:
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

QUESTION:
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A.

QUESTION:
In a small restaurant there are a tables for one person and b tables for two persons. 

It it known that n groups of people come today, each consisting of one or two people. 

If a group consist of one person, it is seated at a vacant one-seater table. If there are none of them, it is seated at a vacant two-seater table. If there are none of them, it is seated at a two-seater table occupied by single person. If there are still none of them, the restaurant denies service to this group.

If a group consist of two people, it is seated at a vacant two-seater table. If there are none of them, the restaurant denies service to this group.

You are given a chronological order of groups coming. You are to determine the total number of people the restaurant denies service to.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of groups coming to the restaurant, the number of one-seater and the number of two-seater tables.

The second line contains a sequence of integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 2) — the description of clients in chronological order. If t_{i} is equal to one, then the i-th group consists of one person, otherwise the i-th group consists of two people.


-----Output-----

Print the total number of people the restaurant denies service to.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 1 2
1 2 1 1

Output
0

Input
4 1 1
1 1 2 1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example the first group consists of one person, it is seated at a vacant one-seater table. The next group occupies a whole two-seater table. The third group consists of one person, it occupies one place at the remaining two-seater table. The fourth group consists of one person, he is seated at the remaining seat at the two-seater table. Thus, all clients are served.

In the second example the first group consists of one person, it is seated at the vacant one-seater table. The next group consists of one person, it occupies one place at the two-seater table. It's impossible to seat the next group of two people, so the restaurant denies service to them. The fourth group consists of one person, he is seated at the remaining seat at the two-seater table. Thus, the restaurant denies service to 2 clients.

QUESTION:
Each student eagerly awaits the day he would pass the exams successfully. Thus, Vasya was ready to celebrate, but, alas, he didn't pass it. However, many of Vasya's fellow students from the same group were more successful and celebrated after the exam.

Some of them celebrated in the BugDonalds restaurant, some of them — in the BeaverKing restaurant, the most successful ones were fast enough to celebrate in both of restaurants. Students which didn't pass the exam didn't celebrate in any of those restaurants and elected to stay home to prepare for their reexamination. However, this quickly bored Vasya and he started checking celebration photos on the Kilogramm. He found out that, in total, BugDonalds was visited by $A$ students, BeaverKing — by $B$ students and $C$ students visited both restaurants. Vasya also knows that there are $N$ students in his group.

Based on this info, Vasya wants to determine either if his data contradicts itself or, if it doesn't, how many students in his group didn't pass the exam. Can you help him so he won't waste his valuable preparation time?


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers — $A$, $B$, $C$ and $N$ ($0 \leq A, B, C, N \leq 100$).


-----Output-----

If a distribution of $N$ students exists in which $A$ students visited BugDonalds, $B$ — BeaverKing, $C$ — both of the restaurants and at least one student is left home (it is known that Vasya didn't pass the exam and stayed at home), output one integer — amount of students (including Vasya) who did not pass the exam. 

If such a distribution does not exist and Vasya made a mistake while determining the numbers $A$, $B$, $C$ or $N$ (as in samples 2 and 3), output $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 10 5 20

Output
5
Input
2 2 0 4

Output
-1
Input
2 2 2 1

Output
-1


-----Note-----

The first sample describes following situation: $5$ only visited BugDonalds, $5$ students only visited BeaverKing, $5$ visited both of them and $5$ students (including Vasya) didn't pass the exam.

In the second sample $2$ students only visited BugDonalds and $2$ only visited BeaverKing, but that means all $4$ students in group passed the exam which contradicts the fact that Vasya didn't pass meaning that this situation is impossible.

The third sample describes a situation where $2$ students visited BugDonalds but the group has only $1$ which makes it clearly impossible.

QUESTION:
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

QUESTION:
An online contest will soon be held on ForceCoders, a large competitive programming platform. The authors have prepared $n$ problems; and since the platform is very popular, $998244351$ coder from all over the world is going to solve them.

For each problem, the authors estimated the number of people who would solve it: for the $i$-th problem, the number of accepted solutions will be between $l_i$ and $r_i$, inclusive.

The creator of ForceCoders uses different criteria to determine if the contest is good or bad. One of these criteria is the number of inversions in the problem order. An inversion is a pair of problems $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is located earlier in the contest ($x < y$), but the number of accepted solutions for $y$ is strictly greater.

Obviously, both the creator of ForceCoders and the authors of the contest want the contest to be good. Now they want to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, assuming that for each problem $i$, any integral number of accepted solutions for it (between $l_i$ and $r_i$) is equally probable, and all these numbers are independent.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — the number of problems in the contest.

Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \le l_i \le r_i \le 998244351$) — the minimum and maximum number of accepted solutions for the $i$-th problem, respectively.


-----Output-----

The probability that there will be no inversions in the contest can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\frac{x}{y}$, where $y$ is coprime with $998244353$. Print one integer — the value of $xy^{-1}$, taken modulo $998244353$, where $y^{-1}$ is an integer such that $yy^{-1} \equiv 1$ $(mod$ $998244353)$.

QUESTION:
Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.

QUESTION:
The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input

-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.

QUESTION:
The 9-th grade student Gabriel noticed a caterpillar on a tree when walking around in a forest after the classes. The caterpillar was on the height h_1 cm from the ground. On the height h_2 cm (h_2 > h_1) on the same tree hung an apple and the caterpillar was crawling to the apple.

Gabriel is interested when the caterpillar gets the apple. He noted that the caterpillar goes up by a cm per hour by day and slips down by b cm per hour by night.

In how many days Gabriel should return to the forest to see the caterpillar get the apple. You can consider that the day starts at 10 am and finishes at 10 pm. Gabriel's classes finish at 2 pm. You can consider that Gabriel noticed the caterpillar just after the classes at 2 pm.

Note that the forest is magic so the caterpillar can slip down under the ground and then lift to the apple.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers h_1, h_2 (1 ≤ h_1 < h_2 ≤ 10^5) — the heights of the position of the caterpillar and the apple in centimeters.

The second line contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5) — the distance the caterpillar goes up by day and slips down by night, in centimeters per hour.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer k — the number of days Gabriel should wait to return to the forest and see the caterpillar getting the apple.

If the caterpillar can't get the apple print the only integer  - 1.

Note that in the last example the caterpillar was slipping down under the ground and getting the apple on the next day.

QUESTION:
A sweet little monster Om Nom loves candies very much. One day he found himself in a rather tricky situation that required him to think a bit in order to enjoy candies the most. Would you succeed with the same task if you were on his place? [Image] 

One day, when he came to his friend Evan, Om Nom didn't find him at home but he found two bags with candies. The first was full of blue candies and the second bag was full of red candies. Om Nom knows that each red candy weighs W_{r} grams and each blue candy weighs W_{b} grams. Eating a single red candy gives Om Nom H_{r} joy units and eating a single blue candy gives Om Nom H_{b} joy units.

Candies are the most important thing in the world, but on the other hand overeating is not good. Om Nom knows if he eats more than C grams of candies, he will get sick. Om Nom thinks that it isn't proper to leave candy leftovers, so he can only eat a whole candy. Om Nom is a great mathematician and he quickly determined how many candies of what type he should eat in order to get the maximum number of joy units. Can you repeat his achievement? You can assume that each bag contains more candies that Om Nom can eat.


-----Input-----

The single line contains five integers C, H_{r}, H_{b}, W_{r}, W_{b} (1 ≤ C, H_{r}, H_{b}, W_{r}, W_{b} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of joy units that Om Nom can get.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 3 5 2 3

Output
16



-----Note-----

In the sample test Om Nom can eat two candies of each type and thus get 16 joy units.

QUESTION:
Professor GukiZ makes a new robot. The robot are in the point with coordinates (x_1, y_1) and should go to the point (x_2, y_2). In a single step the robot can change any of its coordinates (maybe both of them) by one (decrease or increase). So the robot can move in one of the 8 directions. Find the minimal number of steps the robot should make to get the finish position.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers x_1, y_1 ( - 10^9 ≤ x_1, y_1 ≤ 10^9) — the start position of the robot.

The second line contains two integers x_2, y_2 ( - 10^9 ≤ x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^9) — the finish position of the robot.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer d — the minimal number of steps to get the finish position.


-----Examples-----
Input
0 0
4 5

Output
5

Input
3 4
6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example robot should increase both of its coordinates by one four times, so it will be in position (4, 4). After that robot should simply increase its y coordinate and get the finish position.

In the second example robot should simultaneously increase x coordinate and decrease y coordinate by one three times.

QUESTION:
There are n employees in Alternative Cake Manufacturing (ACM). They are now voting on some very important question and the leading world media are trying to predict the outcome of the vote.

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction. 

You know the order employees are going to vote and that they behave optimal (and they also know the order and who belongs to which fraction). Predict the outcome of the vote.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of employees. 

The next line contains n characters. The i-th character is 'D' if the i-th employee is from depublicans fraction or 'R' if he is from remocrats.


-----Output-----

Print 'D' if the outcome of the vote will be suitable for depublicans and 'R' if remocrats will win.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
DDRRR

Output
D

Input
6
DDRRRR

Output
R



-----Note-----

Consider one of the voting scenarios for the first sample:   Employee 1 denies employee 5 to vote.  Employee 2 denies employee 3 to vote.  Employee 3 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 2).  Employee 4 denies employee 2 to vote.  Employee 5 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 1).  Employee 1 denies employee 4.  Only employee 1 now has the right to vote so the voting ends with the victory of depublicans.

QUESTION:
Monocarp has decided to buy a new TV set and hang it on the wall in his flat. The wall has enough free space so Monocarp can buy a TV set with screen width not greater than $a$ and screen height not greater than $b$. Monocarp is also used to TV sets with a certain aspect ratio: formally, if the width of the screen is $w$, and the height of the screen is $h$, then the following condition should be met: $\frac{w}{h} = \frac{x}{y}$.

There are many different TV sets in the shop. Monocarp is sure that for any pair of positive integers $w$ and $h$ there is a TV set with screen width $w$ and height $h$ in the shop.

Monocarp isn't ready to choose the exact TV set he is going to buy. Firstly he wants to determine the optimal screen resolution. He has decided to try all possible variants of screen size. But he must count the number of pairs of positive integers $w$ and $h$, beforehand, such that $(w \le a)$, $(h \le b)$ and $(\frac{w}{h} = \frac{x}{y})$.

In other words, Monocarp wants to determine the number of TV sets having aspect ratio $\frac{x}{y}$, screen width not exceeding $a$, and screen height not exceeding $b$. Two TV sets are considered different if they have different screen width or different screen height.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ ($1 \le a, b, x, y \le 10^{18}$) — the constraints on the screen width and height, and on the aspect ratio.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of different variants to choose TV screen width and screen height so that they meet the aforementioned constraints.


-----Examples-----
Input
17 15 5 3

Output

Output
1000000063



-----Note-----

In the first example, there are $3$ possible variants: $(5, 3)$, $(10, 6)$, $(15, 9)$.

In the second example, there is no TV set meeting the constraints.

In the third example, there is only one variant: $(3, 2)$.

QUESTION:
The number ""zero"" is called ""love"" (or ""l'oeuf"" to be precise, literally means ""egg"" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number $9200$ has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers $n$ and $b$ (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary (in the base/radix of $b$) representation of $n\,!$ (factorial of $n$). 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $b$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$, $2 \le b \le 10^{12}$).


-----Output-----

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary representation of $n!$


-----Examples-----
Input
6 9

Output
1

Input
38 11

Output
3

Input
5 2

Output
3

Input
5 10

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, $6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}$.

In the third and fourth example, $5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}$.

The representation of the number $x$ in the $b$-ary base is $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ if $x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + \ldots + d_k b^0$, where $d_i$ are integers and $0 \le d_i \le b - 1$. For example, the number $720$ from the first example is represented as $880_{(9)}$ since $720 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9 + 0 \cdot 1$.

QUESTION:
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

QUESTION:
Where do odds begin, and where do they end? Where does hope emerge, and will they ever break?

Given an integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of length n. Decide whether it is possible to divide it into an odd number of non-empty subsegments, the each of which has an odd length and begins and ends with odd numbers.

A subsegment is a contiguous slice of the whole sequence. For example, {3, 4, 5} and {1} are subsegments of sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, while {1, 2, 4} and {7} are not.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a non-negative integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output ""Yes"" if it's possible to fulfill the requirements, and ""No"" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 0 1 5 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
4 3 1

Output
No

Input
4
3 9 9 3

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, divide the sequence into 1 subsegment: {1, 3, 5} and the requirements will be met.

In the second example, divide the sequence into 3 subsegments: {1, 0, 1}, {5}, {1}.

In the third example, one of the subsegments must start with 4 which is an even number, thus the requirements cannot be met.

In the fourth example, the sequence can be divided into 2 subsegments: {3, 9, 9}, {3}, but this is not a valid solution because 2 is an even number.

QUESTION:
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).

QUESTION:
One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing ""NO"" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print ""YES"" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

QUESTION:
Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.

Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Input-----

The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4 2

Output
6



-----Note-----

Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.

Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.

Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.

QUESTION:
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print ""NO"" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print ""YES"" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES

QUESTION:
In a building where Polycarp lives there are equal number of flats on each floor. Unfortunately, Polycarp don't remember how many flats are on each floor, but he remembers that the flats are numbered from 1 from lower to upper floors. That is, the first several flats are on the first floor, the next several flats are on the second and so on. Polycarp don't remember the total number of flats in the building, so you can consider the building to be infinitely high (i.e. there are infinitely many floors). Note that the floors are numbered from 1.

Polycarp remembers on which floors several flats are located. It is guaranteed that this information is not self-contradictory. It means that there exists a building with equal number of flats on each floor so that the flats from Polycarp's memory have the floors Polycarp remembers.

Given this information, is it possible to restore the exact floor for flat n? 


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100), where n is the number of the flat you need to restore floor for, and m is the number of flats in Polycarp's memory.

m lines follow, describing the Polycarp's memory: each of these lines contains a pair of integers k_{i}, f_{i} (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 100, 1 ≤ f_{i} ≤ 100), which means that the flat k_{i} is on the f_{i}-th floor. All values k_{i} are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the given information is not self-contradictory.


-----Output-----

Print the number of the floor in which the n-th flat is located, if it is possible to determine it in a unique way. Print -1 if it is not possible to uniquely restore this floor.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 3
6 2
2 1
7 3

Output
4

Input
8 4
3 1
6 2
5 2
2 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the 6-th flat is on the 2-nd floor, while the 7-th flat is on the 3-rd, so, the 6-th flat is the last on its floor and there are 3 flats on each floor. Thus, the 10-th flat is on the 4-th floor.

In the second example there can be 3 or 4 flats on each floor, so we can't restore the floor for the 8-th flat.

QUESTION:
Bishwock is a chess figure that consists of three squares resembling an ""L-bar"". This figure can be rotated by 90, 180 and 270 degrees so it can have four possible states:

 

XX   XX   .X   X.

X.   .X   XX   XX

 

Bishwocks don't attack any squares and can even occupy on the adjacent squares as long as they don't occupy the same square. 

Vasya has a board with $2\times n$ squares onto which he wants to put some bishwocks. To his dismay, several squares on this board are already occupied by pawns and Vasya can't put bishwocks there. However, pawns also don't attack bishwocks and they can occupy adjacent squares peacefully.

Knowing the positions of pawns on the board, help Vasya to determine the maximum amount of bishwocks he can put onto the board so that they wouldn't occupy the same squares and wouldn't occupy squares with pawns.


-----Input-----

The input contains two nonempty strings that describe Vasya's board. Those strings contain only symbols ""0"" (zero) that denote the empty squares and symbols ""X"" (uppercase English letter) that denote the squares occupied by pawns. Strings are nonempty and are of the same length that does not exceed $100$.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum amount of bishwocks that can be placed onto the given board.

QUESTION:
Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.

QUESTION:
You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.

QUESTION:
A bus moves along the coordinate line Ox from the point x = 0 to the point x = a. After starting from the point x = 0, it reaches the point x = a, immediately turns back and then moves to the point x = 0. After returning to the point x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point x = a and so on. Thus, the bus moves from x = 0 to x = a and back. Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.

The petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.

There is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and x = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain b liters of gasoline.

What is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point x = f to make k journeys? The first journey starts in the point x = 0.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers a, b, f, k (0 < f < a ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4) — the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to make k journeys. If it is impossible for the bus to make k journeys, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 9 2 4

Output
4

Input
6 10 2 4

Output
2

Input
6 5 4 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the bus needs to refuel during each journey.

In the second example the bus can pass 10 units of distance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. 

In the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling.

QUESTION:
You are given the string s of length n and the numbers p, q. Split the string s to pieces of length p and q.

For example, the string ""Hello"" for p = 2, q = 3 can be split to the two strings ""Hel"" and ""lo"" or to the two strings ""He"" and ""llo"".

Note it is allowed to split the string s to the strings only of length p or to the strings only of length q (see the second sample test).


-----Input-----

The first line contains three positive integers n, p, q (1 ≤ p, q ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains the string s consists of lowercase and uppercase latin letters and digits.


-----Output-----

If it's impossible to split the string s to the strings of length p and q print the only number ""-1"".

Otherwise in the first line print integer k — the number of strings in partition of s.

Each of the next k lines should contain the strings in partition. Each string should be of the length p or q. The string should be in order of their appearing in string s — from left to right.

If there are several solutions print any of them.

QUESTION:
A sportsman starts from point x_{start} = 0 and runs to point with coordinate x_{finish} = m (on a straight line). Also, the sportsman can jump — to jump, he should first take a run of length of not less than s meters (in this case for these s meters his path should have no obstacles), and after that he can jump over a length of not more than d meters. Running and jumping is permitted only in the direction from left to right. He can start andfinish a jump only at the points with integer coordinates in which there are no obstacles. To overcome some obstacle, it is necessary to land at a point which is strictly to the right of this obstacle.

On the way of an athlete are n obstacles at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. He cannot go over the obstacles, he can only jump over them. Your task is to determine whether the athlete will be able to get to the finish point.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containsd four integers n, m, s and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9) — the number of obstacles on the runner's way, the coordinate of the finishing point, the length of running before the jump and the maximum length of the jump, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ m - 1) — the coordinates of the obstacles. It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing point have no obstacles, also no point can have more than one obstacle, The coordinates of the obstacles are given in an arbitrary order.


-----Output-----

If the runner cannot reach the finishing point, print in the first line of the output ""IMPOSSIBLE"" (without the quotes).

If the athlete can get from start to finish, print any way to do this in the following format:  print a line of form ""RUN X>"" (where ""X"" should be a positive integer), if the athlete should run for ""X"" more meters;  print a line of form ""JUMP Y"" (where ""Y"" should be a positive integer), if the sportsman starts a jump and should remain in air for ""Y"" more meters. 

All commands ""RUN"" and ""JUMP"" should strictly alternate, starting with ""RUN"", besides, they should be printed chronologically. It is not allowed to jump over the finishing point but it is allowed to land there after a jump. The athlete should stop as soon as he reaches finish.

QUESTION:
Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.

QUESTION:
You are given a positive integer $n$, written without leading zeroes (for example, the number 04 is incorrect). 

In one operation you can delete any digit of the given integer so that the result remains a positive integer without leading zeros.

Determine the minimum number of operations that you need to consistently apply to the given integer $n$ to make from it the square of some positive integer or report that it is impossible.

An integer $x$ is the square of some positive integer if and only if $x=y^2$ for some positive integer $y$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{9}$). The number is given without leading zeroes.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make the square of some positive integer from $n$, print -1. In the other case, print the minimal number of operations required to do it.


-----Examples-----
Input
8314

Output
2

Input
625

Output
0

Input
333

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example we should delete from $8314$ the digits $3$ and $4$. After that $8314$ become equals to $81$, which is the square of the integer $9$.

In the second example the given $625$ is the square of the integer $25$, so you should not delete anything. 

In the third example it is impossible to make the square from $333$, so the answer is -1.

QUESTION:
Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1
Input
3

Output
4
Input
6

Output
120


-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.

QUESTION:
One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

QUESTION:
Dawid has four bags of candies. The $i$-th of them contains $a_i$ candies. Also, Dawid has two friends. He wants to give each bag to one of his two friends. Is it possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies in total?

Note, that you can't keep bags for yourself or throw them away, each bag should be given to one of the friends.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$ and $a_4$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 100$) — the numbers of candies in each bag.


-----Output-----

Output YES if it's possible to give the bags to Dawid's friends so that both friends receive the same amount of candies, or NO otherwise. Each character can be printed in any case (either uppercase or lowercase).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7 11 5

Output
YES

Input
7 3 2 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Dawid can give the first and the third bag to the first friend, and the second and the fourth bag to the second friend. This way, each friend will receive $12$ candies.

In the second sample test, it's impossible to distribute the bags.

QUESTION:
You may have heard of the pie rule before. It states that if two people wish to fairly share a slice of pie, one person should cut the slice in half, and the other person should choose who gets which slice. Alice and Bob have many slices of pie, and rather than cutting the slices in half, each individual slice will be eaten by just one person.

The way Alice and Bob decide who eats each slice is as follows. First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the ""decider"" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.

All of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?


-----Input-----

Input will begin with an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), the number of slices of pie. 

Following this is a line with N integers indicating the sizes of the slices (each between 1 and 100000, inclusive), in the order in which they must be handed out.


-----Output-----

Print two integers. First, the sum of the sizes of slices eaten by Alice, then the sum of the sizes of the slices eaten by Bob, assuming both players make their decisions optimally.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
141 592 653

Output
653 733

Input
5
10 21 10 21 10

Output
31 41



-----Note-----

In the first example, Bob takes the size 141 slice for himself and gives the decider token to Alice. Then Alice gives the size 592 slice to Bob and keeps the decider token for herself, so that she can then give the size 653 slice to herself.

QUESTION:
You've got a positive integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. All numbers in the sequence are distinct. Let's fix the set of variables b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. Initially each variable b_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of n operations.

The first operation is assigning the value of a_1 to some variable b_{x} (1 ≤ x ≤ m). Each of the following n - 1 operations is assigning to some variable b_{y} the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables b_{i} and b_{j} (1 ≤ i, j, y ≤ m). At that, the value that is assigned on the t-th operation, must equal a_{t}. For each operation numbers y, i, j are chosen anew.

Your task is to find the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single number — the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.

If you cannot perform the sequence of operations at any m, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 6 8

Output
2

Input
3
3 6 5

Output
-1

Input
6
2 4 8 6 10 18

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample, you can use two variables b_1 and b_2 to perform the following sequence of operations.  b_1 := 1;  b_2 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2;  b_1 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2.

QUESTION:
Alice and Bob are playing a game with $n$ piles of stones. It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number. The $i$-th pile has $a_i$ stones.

Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.

On a player's turn, they must choose exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $\frac{n}{2}$ nonempty piles).

Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 50$) — the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 50$) — the number of stones in the piles.


-----Output-----

Print a single string ""Alice"" if Alice wins; otherwise, print ""Bob"" (without double quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
8 8

Output
Bob

Input
4
3 1 4 1

Output
Alice



-----Note-----

In the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ($\frac{2}{2}=1$). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first.

In the second example, Alice can remove $2$ stones from the first pile and $3$ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.

QUESTION:
Today, hedgehog Filya went to school for the very first time! Teacher gave him a homework which Filya was unable to complete without your help.

Filya is given an array of non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. First, he pick an integer x and then he adds x to some elements of the array (no more than once), subtract x from some other elements (also, no more than once) and do no change other elements. He wants all elements of the array to be equal.

Now he wonders if it's possible to pick such integer x and change some elements of the array using this x in order to make all elements equal.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of integers in the Filya's array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.


-----Output-----

If it's impossible to make all elements of the array equal using the process given in the problem statement, then print ""NO"" (without quotes) in the only line of the output. Otherwise print ""YES"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 3 3 2 1

Output
YES

Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Filya should select x = 1, then add it to the first and the last elements of the array and subtract from the second and the third elements.

QUESTION:
Given is a string S of length N.
Find the maximum length of a non-empty string that occurs twice or more in S as contiguous substrings without overlapping.
More formally, find the maximum positive integer len such that there exist integers l_1 and l_2 ( 1 \leq l_1, l_2 \leq N - len + 1 ) that satisfy the following:
 - l_1 + len \leq l_2
 - S[l_1+i] = S[l_2+i] (i = 0, 1, ..., len - 1)
If there is no such integer len, print 0.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 5 \times 10^3
 - |S| = N
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print the maximum length of a non-empty string that occurs twice or more in S as contiguous substrings without overlapping. If there is no such non-empty string, print 0 instead.

-----Sample Input-----
5
ababa

-----Sample Output-----
2

The strings satisfying the conditions are: a, b, ab, and ba. The maximum length among them is 2, which is the answer.
Note that aba occurs twice in S as contiguous substrings, but there is no pair of integers l_1 and l_2 mentioned in the statement such that l_1 + len \leq l_2.

QUESTION:
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. [Image] 

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

QUESTION:
There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES

QUESTION:
Mishka is a little polar bear. As known, little bears loves spending their free time playing dice for chocolates. Once in a wonderful sunny morning, walking around blocks of ice, Mishka met her friend Chris, and they started playing the game.

Rules of the game are very simple: at first number of rounds n is defined. In every round each of the players throws a cubical dice with distinct numbers from 1 to 6 written on its faces. Player, whose value after throwing the dice is greater, wins the round. In case if player dice values are equal, no one of them is a winner.

In average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is draw.

Mishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you to watch their game and determine its result. Please help her!


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains single integer n n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of game rounds.

The next n lines contains rounds description. i-th of them contains pair of integers m_{i} and c_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i},  c_{i} ≤ 6) — values on dice upper face after Mishka's and Chris' throws in i-th round respectively.


-----Output-----

If Mishka is the winner of the game, print ""Mishka"" (without quotes) in the only line.

If Chris is the winner of the game, print ""Chris"" (without quotes) in the only line.

If the result of the game is draw, print ""Friendship is magic!^^"" (without quotes) in the only line.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
3 5
2 1
4 2

Output
Mishka
Input
2
6 1
1 6

Output
Friendship is magic!^^
Input
3
1 5
3 3
2 2

Output
Chris


-----Note-----

In the first sample case Mishka loses the first round, but wins second and third rounds and thus she is the winner of the game.

In the second sample case Mishka wins the first round, Chris wins the second round, and the game ends with draw with score 1:1.

In the third sample case Chris wins the first round, but there is no winner of the next two rounds. The winner of the game is Chris.

QUESTION:
One day Alex decided to remember childhood when computers were not too powerful and lots of people played only default games. Alex enjoyed playing Minesweeper that time. He imagined that he saved world from bombs planted by terrorists, but he rarely won.

Alex has grown up since then, so he easily wins the most difficult levels. This quickly bored him, and he thought: what if the computer gave him invalid fields in the childhood and Alex could not win because of it?

He needs your help to check it.

A Minesweeper field is a rectangle $n \times m$, where each cell is either empty, or contains a digit from $1$ to $8$, or a bomb. The field is valid if for each cell:   if there is a digit $k$ in the cell, then exactly $k$ neighboring cells have bombs.  if the cell is empty, then all neighboring cells have no bombs. 

Two cells are neighbors if they have a common side or a corner (i. e. a cell has at most $8$ neighboring cells).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 100$) — the sizes of the field.

The next $n$ lines contain the description of the field. Each line contains $m$ characters, each of them is ""."" (if this cell is empty), ""*"" (if there is bomb in this cell), or a digit from $1$ to $8$, inclusive.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"", if the field is valid and ""NO"" otherwise.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrarily.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
111
1*1
111

Output
YES
Input
2 4
*.*.
1211

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the second example the answer is ""NO"" because, if the positions of the bombs are preserved, the first line of the field should be *2*1.

You can read more about Minesweeper in Wikipedia's article.

QUESTION:
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

QUESTION:
A necklace can be described as a string of links ('-') and pearls ('o'), with the last link or pearl connected to the first one. $0$ 

You can remove a link or a pearl and insert it between two other existing links or pearls (or between a link and a pearl) on the necklace. This process can be repeated as many times as you like, but you can't throw away any parts.

Can you make the number of links between every two adjacent pearls equal? Two pearls are considered to be adjacent if there is no other pearl between them.

Note that the final necklace should remain as one circular part of the same length as the initial necklace.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a string $s$ ($3 \leq |s| \leq 100$), representing the necklace, where a dash '-' represents a link and the lowercase English letter 'o' represents a pearl.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if the links and pearls can be rejoined such that the number of links between adjacent pearls is equal. Otherwise print ""NO"".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
-o-o--

QUESTION:
n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.

QUESTION:
You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$ and two integers $m$ and $k$.

You can choose some subarray $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{r-1}, a_r$. 

The cost of subarray $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{r-1}, a_r$ is equal to $\sum\limits_{i=l}^{r} a_i - k \lceil \frac{r - l + 1}{m} \rceil$, where $\lceil x \rceil$ is the least integer greater than or equal to $x$. 

The cost of empty subarray is equal to zero.

For example, if $m = 3$, $k = 10$ and $a = [2, -4, 15, -3, 4, 8, 3]$, then the cost of some subarrays are:  $a_3 \dots a_3: 15 - k \lceil \frac{1}{3} \rceil = 15 - 10 = 5$;  $a_3 \dots a_4: (15 - 3) - k \lceil \frac{2}{3} \rceil = 12 - 10 = 2$;  $a_3 \dots a_5: (15 - 3 + 4) - k \lceil \frac{3}{3} \rceil = 16 - 10 = 6$;  $a_3 \dots a_6: (15 - 3 + 4 + 8) - k \lceil \frac{4}{3} \rceil = 24 - 20 = 4$;  $a_3 \dots a_7: (15 - 3 + 4 + 8 + 3) - k \lceil \frac{5}{3} \rceil = 27 - 20 = 7$. 

Your task is to find the maximum cost of some subarray (possibly empty) of array $a$.

QUESTION:
You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.

A polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.


-----Output-----

Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.

Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision.

QUESTION:
Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

QUESTION:
Not so long ago company R2 bought company R1 and consequently, all its developments in the field of multicore processors. Now the R2 laboratory is testing one of the R1 processors.

The testing goes in n steps, at each step the processor gets some instructions, and then its temperature is measured. The head engineer in R2 is keeping a report record on the work of the processor: he writes down the minimum and the maximum measured temperature in his notebook. His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded only m.

The next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all the m temperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbers n, m, min, max and the list of m temperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set of m temperatures to the set of n temperatures (that is add n - m temperatures), so that the minimum temperature was min and the maximum one was max.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers n, m, min, max (1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ min < max ≤ 100). The second line contains m space-separated integers t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 100) — the temperatures reported by the assistant.

Note, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.


-----Output-----

If the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1 1 2
1

Output
Correct

Input
3 1 1 3
2

Output
Correct

Input
2 1 1 3
2

Output
Incorrect



-----Note-----

In the first test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [1, 2].

In the second test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [2, 1, 3].

In the third test sample it is impossible to add one temperature to obtain the minimum equal to 1 and the maximum equal to 3.

QUESTION:
Chouti was tired of the tedious homework, so he opened up an old programming problem he created years ago.

You are given a connected undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ weighted edges. There are $k$ special vertices: $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$.

Let's define the cost of the path as the maximum weight of the edges in it. And the distance between two vertexes as the minimum cost of the paths connecting them.

For each special vertex, find another special vertex which is farthest from it (in terms of the previous paragraph, i.e. the corresponding distance is maximum possible) and output the distance between them.

The original constraints are really small so he thought the problem was boring. Now, he raises the constraints and hopes you can solve it for him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5$, $n-1 \leq m \leq 10^5$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of special vertices.

The second line contains $k$ distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ ($1 \leq x_i \leq n$).

Each of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ ($1 \leq u,v \leq n, 1 \leq w \leq 10^9$), denoting there is an edge between $u$ and $v$ of weight $w$. The given graph is undirected, so an edge $(u, v)$ can be used in the both directions.

The graph may have multiple edges and self-loops.

It is guaranteed, that the graph is connected.


-----Output-----

The first and only line should contain $k$ integers. The $i$-th integer is the distance between $x_i$ and the farthest special vertex from it.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 3 2
2 1
1 2 3
1 2 2
2 2 1

Output
2 2 

Input
4 5 3
1 2 3
1 2 5
4 2 1
2 3 2
1 4 4
1 3 3

Output
3 3 3 



-----Note-----

In the first example, the distance between vertex $1$ and $2$ equals to $2$ because one can walk through the edge of weight $2$ connecting them. So the distance to the farthest node for both $1$ and $2$ equals to $2$.

In the second example, one can find that distance between $1$ and $2$, distance between $1$ and $3$ are both $3$ and the distance between $2$ and $3$ is $2$.

The graph may have multiple edges between and self-loops, as in the first example.

QUESTION:
Bomboslav likes to look out of the window in his room and watch lads outside playing famous shell game. The game is played by two persons: operator and player. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.

Bomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).

Let's number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2. Bomboslav has missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows that exactly n movements were made by the operator and the ball was under shell x at the end. Now he wonders, what was the initial position of the ball?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of movements made by the operator.

The second line contains a single integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) — the index of the shell where the ball was found after n movements.


-----Output-----

Print one integer from 0 to 2 — the index of the shell where the ball was initially placed.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
2

Output
1

Input
1
1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the ball was initially placed beneath the middle shell and the operator completed four movements.  During the first move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell. The ball is now under the left shell.  During the second move operator swapped the middle shell and the right one. The ball is still under the left shell.  During the third move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell again. The ball is again in the middle.  Finally, the operators swapped the middle shell and the right shell. The ball is now beneath the right shell.

QUESTION:
You are given n rectangles. The corners of rectangles have integer coordinates and their edges are parallel to the Ox and Oy axes. The rectangles may touch each other, but they do not overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle). 

Your task is to determine if the rectangles form a square. In other words, determine if the set of points inside or on the border of at least one rectangle is precisely equal to the set of points inside or on the border of some square.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5). Next n lines contain four integers each, describing a single rectangle: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 31400, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 31400) — x_1 and x_2 are x-coordinates of the left and right edges of the rectangle, and y_1 and y_2 are y-coordinates of the bottom and top edges of the rectangle. 

No two rectangles overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle).


-----Output-----

In a single line print ""YES"", if the given rectangles form a square, or ""NO"" otherwise.

QUESTION:
Ivan likes to learn different things about numbers, but he is especially interested in really big numbers. Ivan thinks that a positive integer number x is really big if the difference between x and the sum of its digits (in decimal representation) is not less than s. To prove that these numbers may have different special properties, he wants to know how rare (or not rare) they are — in fact, he needs to calculate the quantity of really big numbers that are not greater than n.

Ivan tried to do the calculations himself, but soon realized that it's too difficult for him. So he asked you to help him in calculations.


-----Input-----

The first (and the only) line contains two integers n and s (1 ≤ n, s ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the quantity of really big numbers that are not greater than n.


-----Examples-----
Input
12 1

Output
3

Input
25 20

Output
0

Input
10 9

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example numbers 10, 11 and 12 are really big.

In the second example there are no really big numbers that are not greater than 25 (in fact, the first really big number is 30: 30 - 3 ≥ 20).

In the third example 10 is the only really big number (10 - 1 ≥ 9).

QUESTION:
You are given n points on Cartesian plane. Every point is a lattice point (i. e. both of its coordinates are integers), and all points are distinct.

You may draw two straight lines (not necessarily distinct). Is it possible to do this in such a way that every point lies on at least one of these lines?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of points you are given.

Then n lines follow, each line containing two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| ≤ 10^9)— coordinates of i-th point. All n points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to draw two straight lines in such a way that each of given points belongs to at least one of these lines, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
0 0
0 1
1 1
1 -1
2 2

Output
YES

Input
5
0 0
1 0
2 1
1 1
2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to draw two lines, the one containing the points 1, 3 and 5, and another one containing two remaining points. [Image]

QUESTION:
Memory and his friend Lexa are competing to get higher score in one popular computer game. Memory starts with score a and Lexa starts with score b. In a single turn, both Memory and Lexa get some integer in the range [ - k;k] (i.e. one integer among  - k,  - k + 1,  - k + 2, ...,  - 2,  - 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., k - 1, k) and add them to their current scores. The game has exactly t turns. Memory and Lexa, however, are not good at this game, so they both always get a random integer at their turn.

Memory wonders how many possible games exist such that he ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Two games are considered to be different if in at least one turn at least one player gets different score. There are (2k + 1)^2t games in total. Since the answer can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7. Please solve this problem for Memory.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains the four integers a, b, k, and t (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the amount Memory and Lexa start with, the number k, and the number of turns respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the number of possible games satisfying the conditions modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7) in one line.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 2 1

Output
6

Input
1 1 1 2

Output
31

Input
2 12 3 1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with 1 and Lexa starts with 2. If Lexa picks  - 2, Memory can pick 0, 1, or 2 to win. If Lexa picks  - 1, Memory can pick 1 or 2 to win. If Lexa picks 0, Memory can pick 2 to win. If Lexa picks 1 or 2, Memory cannot win. Thus, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games in which Memory wins.

QUESTION:
Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

QUESTION:
As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.

QUESTION:
There is a toy building consisting of $n$ towers. Each tower consists of several cubes standing on each other. The $i$-th tower consists of $h_i$ cubes, so it has height $h_i$.

Let's define operation slice on some height $H$ as following: for each tower $i$, if its height is greater than $H$, then remove some top cubes to make tower's height equal to $H$. Cost of one ""slice"" equals to the total number of removed cubes from all towers.

Let's name slice as good one if its cost is lower or equal to $k$ ($k \ge n$).

 [Image] 

Calculate the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same height. Of course, it is always possible to make it so.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n \le k \le 10^9$) — the number of towers and the restriction on slices, respectively.

The second line contains $n$ space separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$ ($1 \le h_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the initial heights of towers.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same heigth.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 5
3 1 2 2 4

Output
2

Input
4 5
2 3 4 5

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example it's optimal to make $2$ slices. The first slice is on height $2$ (its cost is $3$), and the second one is on height $1$ (its cost is $4$).

QUESTION:
Alice and Bob are playing yet another card game. This time the rules are the following. There are $n$ cards lying in a row in front of them. The $i$-th card has value $a_i$. 

First, Alice chooses a non-empty consecutive segment of cards $[l; r]$ ($l \le r$). After that Bob removes a single card $j$ from that segment $(l \le j \le r)$. The score of the game is the total value of the remaining cards on the segment $(a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{j - 1} + a_{j + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r)$. In particular, if Alice chooses a segment with just one element, then the score after Bob removes the only card is $0$.

Alice wants to make the score as big as possible. Bob takes such a card that the score is as small as possible.

What segment should Alice choose so that the score is maximum possible? Output the maximum score.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of cards.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-30 \le a_i \le 30$) — the values on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the final score of the game.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
5 -2 10 -1 4

Output
6

Input
8
5 2 5 3 -30 -30 6 9

Output
10

Input
3
-10 6 -15

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Alice chooses a segment $[1;5]$ — the entire row of cards. Bob removes card $3$ with the value $10$ from the segment. Thus, the final score is $5 + (-2) + (-1) + 4 = 6$.

In the second example Alice chooses a segment $[1;4]$, so that Bob removes either card $1$ or $3$ with the value $5$, making the answer $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$.

In the third example Alice can choose any of the segments of length $1$: $[1;1]$, $[2;2]$ or $[3;3]$. Bob removes the only card, so the score is $0$. If Alice chooses some other segment then the answer will be less than $0$.

QUESTION:
Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.

QUESTION:
You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

QUESTION:
The Berland State University is hosting a ballroom dance in celebration of its 100500-th anniversary! n boys and m girls are already busy rehearsing waltz, minuet, polonaise and quadrille moves.

We know that several boy&girl pairs are going to be invited to the ball. However, the partners' dancing skill in each pair must differ by at most one.

For each boy, we know his dancing skills. Similarly, for each girl we know her dancing skills. Write a code that can determine the largest possible number of pairs that can be formed from n boys and m girls.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of boys. The second line contains sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100), where a_{i} is the i-th boy's dancing skill.

Similarly, the third line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of girls. The fourth line contains sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} (1 ≤ b_{j} ≤ 100), where b_{j} is the j-th girl's dancing skill.

QUESTION:
Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.


-----Input-----

The input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

If the first team can win, print phrase ""Team 1"" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase ""Team 2"" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print ""Draw"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 100
100 1
99 99
99 99

Output
Team 1

Input
1 1
2 2

Output

-----Note-----

Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.

Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).

QUESTION:
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

QUESTION:
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and ""?"" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is ""?"", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of ""?"" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print ""Monocarp"" (without quotes). Otherwise print ""Bicarp"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

QUESTION:
It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
6 4
9 5

Output
1

Input
5 5
3 3
2 5
5 6
4 9
6 1

Output
3

Input
3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the first bus of the first route arrives at time $6$, and the first bus of the second route arrives at time $9$, so the first route is the answer.

In the second example, a bus of the third route arrives at time $5$, so it is the answer.

In the third example, buses of the first route come at times $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and so fourth, buses of the second route come at times $2$, $5$, $8$, and so fourth and buses of the third route come at times $2$, $6$, $10$, and so on, so $1$ and $2$ are both acceptable answers while $3$ is not.

QUESTION:
One day, after a difficult lecture a diligent student Sasha saw a graffitied desk in the classroom. She came closer and read: ""Find such positive integer n, that among numbers n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2·n there are exactly m numbers which binary representation contains exactly k digits one"".

The girl got interested in the task and she asked you to help her solve it. Sasha knows that you are afraid of large numbers, so she guaranteed that there is an answer that doesn't exceed 10^18.

QUESTION:
In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.

In a new ZeptoLab game called ""King of Thieves"" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way. [Image] 

An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.

A dungeon consists of n segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. 

One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i_1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_{k}, if i_2 - i_1 = i_3 - i_2 = ... = i_{k} - i_{k} - 1. Of course, all segments i_1, i_2, ... i_{k} should be exactly the platforms, not pits. 

Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i_1, i_2, ..., i_5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.

Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of n characters '*' and '.'.


-----Output-----

If the level is good, print the word ""yes"" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word ""no"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
16
.**.*..*.***.**.

Output
yes
Input
11
.*.*...*.*.

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.

QUESTION:
ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon arrived at the entrance of Udayland. There is a n × n magic grid on the entrance which is filled with integers. Chris noticed that exactly one of the cells in the grid is empty, and to enter Udayland, they need to fill a positive integer into the empty cell.

Chris tried filling in random numbers but it didn't work. ZS the Coder realizes that they need to fill in a positive integer such that the numbers in the grid form a magic square. This means that he has to fill in a positive integer so that the sum of the numbers in each row of the grid ($\sum a_{r, i}$), each column of the grid ($\sum a_{i, c}$), and the two long diagonals of the grid (the main diagonal — $\sum a_{i, i}$ and the secondary diagonal — $\sum a_{i, n - i + 1}$) are equal. 

Chris doesn't know what number to fill in. Can you help Chris find the correct positive integer to fill in or determine that it is impossible?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the number of rows and columns of the magic grid.

n lines follow, each of them contains n integers. The j-th number in the i-th of them denotes a_{i}, j (1 ≤ a_{i}, j ≤ 10^9 or a_{i}, j = 0), the number in the i-th row and j-th column of the magic grid. If the corresponding cell is empty, a_{i}, j will be equal to 0. Otherwise, a_{i}, j is positive.

It is guaranteed that there is exactly one pair of integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that a_{i}, j = 0.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) that should be filled in the empty cell so that the whole grid becomes a magic square. If such positive integer x does not exist, output  - 1 instead.

If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
4 0 2
3 5 7
8 1 6

Output
9

Input
4
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1

Output
1

Input
4
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1
1 1 2 1
1 1 1 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample case, we can fill in 9 into the empty cell to make the resulting grid a magic square. Indeed, 

The sum of numbers in each row is:

4 + 9 + 2 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15.

The sum of numbers in each column is:

4 + 3 + 8 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15.

The sum of numbers in the two diagonals is:

4 + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15.

In the third sample case, it is impossible to fill a number in the empty square such that the resulting grid is a magic square.

QUESTION:
There are $n$ benches in the Berland Central park. It is known that $a_i$ people are currently sitting on the $i$-th bench. Another $m$ people are coming to the park and each of them is going to have a seat on some bench out of $n$ available.

Let $k$ be the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional $m$ people came to the park. Calculate the minimum possible $k$ and the maximum possible $k$.

Nobody leaves the taken seat during the whole process.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 100)$ — the number of benches in the park.

The second line contains a single integer $m$ $(1 \le m \le 10\,000)$ — the number of people additionally coming to the park.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains a single integer $a_i$ $(1 \le a_i \le 100)$ — the initial number of people on the $i$-th bench.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum possible $k$ and the maximum possible $k$, where $k$ is the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional $m$ people came to the park.

-----Note-----

In the first example, each of four benches is occupied by a single person. The minimum $k$ is $3$. For example, it is possible to achieve if two newcomers occupy the first bench, one occupies the second bench, one occupies the third bench, and two remaining — the fourth bench. The maximum $k$ is $7$. That requires all six new people to occupy the same bench.

The second example has its minimum $k$ equal to $15$ and maximum $k$ equal to $15$, as there is just a single bench in the park and all $10$ people will occupy it.

QUESTION:
There is an airplane which has n rows from front to back. There will be m people boarding this airplane.

This airplane has an entrance at the very front and very back of the plane.

Each person has some assigned seat. It is possible for multiple people to have the same assigned seat. The people will then board the plane one by one starting with person 1. Each person can independently choose either the front entrance or back entrance to enter the plane.

When a person walks into the plane, they walk directly to their assigned seat and will try to sit in it. If it is occupied, they will continue walking in the direction they walked in until they are at empty seat - they will take the earliest empty seat that they can find. If they get to the end of the row without finding a seat, they will be angry.

Find the number of ways to assign tickets to the passengers and board the plane without anyone getting angry. Two ways are different if there exists a passenger who chose a different entrance in both ways, or the assigned seat is different. Print this count modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), the number of seats, and the number of passengers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number, the number of ways, modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Example-----
Input
3 3

Output
128



-----Note-----

Here, we will denote a passenger by which seat they were assigned, and which side they came from (either ""F"" or ""B"" for front or back, respectively).

For example, one valid way is 3B, 3B, 3B (i.e. all passengers were assigned seat 3 and came from the back entrance). Another valid way would be 2F, 1B, 3F.

One invalid way would be 2B, 2B, 2B, since the third passenger would get to the front without finding a seat.

QUESTION:
A company of $n$ friends wants to order exactly two pizzas. It is known that in total there are $9$ pizza ingredients in nature, which are denoted by integers from $1$ to $9$.

Each of the $n$ friends has one or more favorite ingredients: the $i$-th of friends has the number of favorite ingredients equal to $f_i$ ($1 \le f_i \le 9$) and your favorite ingredients form the sequence $b_{i1}, b_{i2}, \dots, b_{if_i}$ ($1 \le b_{it} \le 9$).

The website of CodePizza restaurant has exactly $m$ ($m \ge 2$) pizzas. Each pizza is characterized by a set of $r_j$ ingredients $a_{j1}, a_{j2}, \dots, a_{jr_j}$ ($1 \le r_j \le 9$, $1 \le a_{jt} \le 9$) , which are included in it, and its price is $c_j$.

Help your friends choose exactly two pizzas in such a way as to please the maximum number of people in the company. It is known that a person is pleased with the choice if each of his/her favorite ingredients is in at least one ordered pizza. If there are several ways to choose two pizzas so as to please the maximum number of friends, then choose the one that minimizes the total price of two pizzas.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5, 2 \le m \le 10^5$) — the number of friends in the company and the number of pizzas, respectively.

Next, the $n$ lines contain descriptions of favorite ingredients of the friends: the $i$-th of them contains the number of favorite ingredients $f_i$ ($1 \le f_i \le 9$) and a sequence of distinct integers $b_{i1}, b_{i2}, \dots, b_{if_i}$ ($1 \le b_{it} \le 9$).

Next, the $m$ lines contain pizza descriptions: the $j$-th of them contains the integer price of the pizza $c_j$ ($1 \le c_j \le 10^9$), the number of ingredients $r_j$ ($1 \le r_j \le 9$) and the ingredients themselves as a sequence of distinct integers $a_{j1}, a_{j2}, \dots, a_{jr_j}$ ($1 \le a_{jt} \le 9$).


-----Output-----

Output two integers $j_1$ and $j_2$ ($1 \le j_1,j_2 \le m$, $j_1 \ne j_2$) denoting the indices of two pizzas in the required set. If there are several solutions, output any of them. Pizza indices can be printed in any order.

QUESTION:
You have a positive integer m and a non-negative integer s. Your task is to find the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have length m and sum of digits s. The required numbers should be non-negative integers written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a pair of integers m, s (1 ≤ m ≤ 100, 0 ≤ s ≤ 900) — the length and the sum of the digits of the required numbers.


-----Output-----

In the output print the pair of the required non-negative integer numbers — first the minimum possible number, then — the maximum possible number. If no numbers satisfying conditions required exist, print the pair of numbers ""-1 -1"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

QUESTION:
Mishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of n integer numbers — saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:

  Each pencil belongs to exactly one box;  Each non-empty box has at least k pencils in it;  If pencils i and j belong to the same box, then |a_{i} - a_{j}| ≤ d, where |x| means absolute value of x. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils i and j such that |a_{i} - a_{j}| ≤ d and they belong to different boxes. 

Help Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print ""YES"" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print ""NO"".


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and d (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9) — the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — saturation of color of each pencil.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes and satisfy all the conditions. Otherwise print ""NO"".


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 10
7 2 7 7 4 2

Output
YES

Input
6 2 3
4 5 3 13 4 10

Output
YES

Input
3 2 5
10 16 22

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to distribute pencils into 2 boxes with 3 pencils in each with any distribution. And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed 10.

In the second example you can split pencils of saturations [4, 5, 3, 4] into 2 boxes of size 2 and put the remaining ones into another box.

QUESTION:
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like ""RYBGRYBGRY"", ""YBGRYBGRYBG"", ""BGRYB"", but can not look like ""BGRYG"", ""YBGRYBYGR"" or ""BGYBGY"". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line ""GRBY!!!B"" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

QUESTION:
There is a cave consisting of N rooms and M one-directional passages. The rooms are numbered 1 through N.
Takahashi is now in Room 1, and Room N has the exit. The i-th passage connects Room s_i and Room t_i (s_i < t_i) and can only be traversed in the direction from Room s_i to Room t_i. It is known that, for each room except Room N, there is at least one passage going from that room.
Takahashi will escape from the cave. Each time he reaches a room (assume that he has reached Room 1 at the beginning), he will choose a passage uniformly at random from the ones going from that room and take that passage.
Aoki, a friend of Takahashi's, can block one of the passages (or do nothing) before Takahashi leaves Room 1. However, it is not allowed to block a passage so that Takahashi is potentially unable to reach Room N.
Let E be the expected number of passages Takahashi takes before he reaches Room N. Find the value of E when Aoki makes a choice that minimizes E.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 600
 - N-1 \leq M \leq \frac{N(N-1)}{2}
 - s_i < t_i
 - If i != j, (s_i, t_i) \neq (s_j, t_j). (Added 21:23 JST)
 - For every v = 1, 2, ..., N-1, there exists i such that v = s_i.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
s_1 t_1
:
s_M t_M

-----Output-----
Print the value of E when Aoki makes a choice that minimizes E.
Your output will be judged as correct when the absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 6
1 4
2 3
1 3
1 2
3 4
2 4

-----Sample Output-----
1.5000000000

If Aoki blocks the passage from Room 1 to Room 2, Takahashi will go along the path 1 → 3 → 4 with probability \frac{1}{2} and 1 → 4 with probability \frac{1}{2}. E = 1.5 here, and this is the minimum possible value of E.

QUESTION:
Vasya has a non-negative integer n. He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with 0. If n already ends up with 0, Vasya considers it already rounded.

For example, if n = 4722 answer is 4720. If n = 5 Vasya can round it to 0 or to 10. Both ways are correct.

For given n find out to which integer will Vasya round it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — number that Vasya has.


-----Output-----

Print result of rounding n. Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.


-----Examples-----
Input
5

Output
0

Input
113

Output
110

Input
1000000000

Output
1000000000

Input

QUESTION:
Santa Claus decided to disassemble his keyboard to clean it. After he returned all the keys back, he suddenly realized that some pairs of keys took each other's place! That is, Santa suspects that each key is either on its place, or on the place of another key, which is located exactly where the first key should be. 

In order to make sure that he's right and restore the correct order of keys, Santa typed his favorite patter looking only to his keyboard.

You are given the Santa's favorite patter and the string he actually typed. Determine which pairs of keys could be mixed. Each key must occur in pairs at most once.


-----Input-----

The input consists of only two strings s and t denoting the favorite Santa's patter and the resulting string. s and t are not empty and have the same length, which is at most 1000. Both strings consist only of lowercase English letters.


-----Output-----

If Santa is wrong, and there is no way to divide some of keys into pairs and swap keys in each pair so that the keyboard will be fixed, print «-1» (without quotes).

Otherwise, the first line of output should contain the only integer k (k ≥ 0) — the number of pairs of keys that should be swapped. The following k lines should contain two space-separated letters each, denoting the keys which should be swapped. All printed letters must be distinct.

If there are several possible answers, print any of them. You are free to choose the order of the pairs and the order of keys in a pair.

Each letter must occur at most once. Santa considers the keyboard to be fixed if he can print his favorite patter without mistakes.

QUESTION:
The preferred way to generate user login in Polygon is to concatenate a prefix of the user's first name and a prefix of their last name, in that order. Each prefix must be non-empty, and any of the prefixes can be the full name. Typically there are multiple possible logins for each person.

You are given the first and the last name of a user. Return the alphabetically earliest login they can get (regardless of other potential Polygon users).

As a reminder, a prefix of a string s is its substring which occurs at the beginning of s: ""a"", ""ab"", ""abc"" etc. are prefixes of string ""{abcdef}"" but ""b"" and 'bc"" are not. A string a is alphabetically earlier than a string b, if a is a prefix of b, or a and b coincide up to some position, and then a has a letter that is alphabetically earlier than the corresponding letter in b: ""a"" and ""ab"" are alphabetically earlier than ""ac"" but ""b"" and ""ba"" are alphabetically later than ""ac"".


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single line containing two space-separated strings: the first and the last names. Each character of each string is a lowercase English letter. The length of each string is between 1 and 10, inclusive. 


-----Output-----

Output a single string — alphabetically earliest possible login formed from these names. The output should be given in lowercase as well.

QUESTION:
A sequence of square brackets is regular if by inserting symbols ""+"" and ""1"" into it, you can get a regular mathematical expression from it. For example, sequences ""[[]][]"", ""[]"" and ""[[][[]]]"" — are regular, at the same time ""]["", ""[[]"" and ""[[]]]["" — are irregular. 

Draw the given sequence using a minimalistic pseudographics in the strip of the lowest possible height — use symbols '+', '-' and '|'. For example, the sequence ""[[][]][]"" should be represented as: 

+-        -++- -+    

|+- -++- -+||   |

||   ||   |||   |

|+- -++- -+||   |

+-        -++- -+



Each bracket should be represented with the hepl of one or more symbols '|' (the vertical part) and symbols '+' and '-' as on the example which is given above.

Brackets should be drawn without spaces one by one, only dividing pairs of consecutive pairwise brackets with a single-space bar (so that the two brackets do not visually merge into one symbol). The image should have the minimum possible height. 

The enclosed bracket is always smaller than the surrounding bracket, but each bracket separately strives to maximize the height of the image. So the pair of final brackets in the example above occupies the entire height of the image.

Study carefully the examples below, they adequately explain the condition of the problem. Pay attention that in this problem the answer (the image) is unique. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the sequence of brackets.

The second line contains the sequence of brackets — these are n symbols ""["" and ""]"". It is guaranteed that the given sequence of brackets is regular. 


-----Output-----

Print the drawn bracket sequence in the format which is given in the condition. Don't print extra (unnecessary) spaces. 


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it ""golden system"". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print "">"" if the first number is larger, ""<"" if it is smaller and ""="" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.

QUESTION:
You took a peek on Thanos wearing Infinity Gauntlet. In the Gauntlet there is a place for six Infinity Gems:  the Power Gem of purple color,  the Time Gem of green color,  the Space Gem of blue color,  the Soul Gem of orange color,  the Reality Gem of red color,  the Mind Gem of yellow color. 

Using colors of Gems you saw in the Gauntlet determine the names of absent Gems.


-----Input-----

In the first line of input there is one integer $n$ ($0 \le n \le 6$) — the number of Gems in Infinity Gauntlet.

In next $n$ lines there are colors of Gems you saw. Words used for colors are: purple, green, blue, orange, red, yellow. It is guaranteed that all the colors are distinct. All colors are given in lowercase English letters.


-----Output-----

In the first line output one integer $m$ ($0 \le m \le 6$) — the number of absent Gems.

Then in $m$ lines print the names of absent Gems, each on its own line. Words used for names are: Power, Time, Space, Soul, Reality, Mind. Names can be printed in any order. Keep the first letter uppercase, others lowercase.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
red
purple
yellow
orange

Output
2
Space
Time

Input
0

Output
6
Time
Mind
Soul
Power
Reality
Space



-----Note-----

In the first sample Thanos already has Reality, Power, Mind and Soul Gems, so he needs two more: Time and Space.

In the second sample Thanos doesn't have any Gems, so he needs all six.

QUESTION:
The last stage of Football World Cup is played using the play-off system.

There are n teams left in this stage, they are enumerated from 1 to n. Several rounds are held, in each round the remaining teams are sorted in the order of their ids, then the first in this order plays with the second, the third — with the fourth, the fifth — with the sixth, and so on. It is guaranteed that in each round there is even number of teams. The winner of each game advances to the next round, the loser is eliminated from the tournament, there are no draws. In the last round there is the only game with two remaining teams: the round is called the Final, the winner is called the champion, and the tournament is over.

Arkady wants his two favorite teams to play in the Final. Unfortunately, the team ids are already determined, and it may happen that it is impossible for teams to meet in the Final, because they are to meet in some earlier stage, if they are strong enough. Determine, in which round the teams with ids a and b can meet.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, a and b (2 ≤ n ≤ 256, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the total number of teams, and the ids of the teams that Arkady is interested in. 

It is guaranteed that n is such that in each round an even number of team advance, and that a and b are not equal.


-----Output-----

In the only line print ""Final!"" (without quotes), if teams a and b can meet in the Final.

Otherwise, print a single integer — the number of the round in which teams a and b can meet. The round are enumerated from 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 1 2

Output
1

Input
8 2 6

Output
Final!

Input
8 7 5

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example teams 1 and 2 meet in the first round.

In the second example teams 2 and 6 can only meet in the third round, which is the Final, if they win all their opponents in earlier rounds.

In the third example the teams with ids 7 and 5 can meet in the second round, if they win their opponents in the first round.

QUESTION:
Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.

QUESTION:
The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.

QUESTION:
There are N camels numbered 1 through N.
The weight of Camel i is w_i.
You will arrange the camels in a line and make them cross a bridge consisting of M parts.
Before they cross the bridge, you can choose their order in the line - it does not have to be Camel 1, 2, \ldots, N from front to back - and specify the distance between each adjacent pair of camels to be any non-negative real number.
The camels will keep the specified distances between them while crossing the bridge.
The i-th part of the bridge has length l_i and weight capacity v_i.
If the sum of the weights of camels inside a part (excluding the endpoints) exceeds v_i, the bridge will collapse.
Determine whether it is possible to make the camels cross the bridge without it collapsing. If it is possible, find the minimum possible distance between the first and last camels in the line in such a case.
It can be proved that the answer is always an integer, so print an integer.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 8
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq w_i,l_i,v_i \leq 10^8

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
w_1 w_2 \cdots w_N
l_1 v_1
\vdots
l_M v_M

-----Output-----
If the bridge will unavoidably collapse when the camels cross the bridge, print -1.
Otherwise, print the minimum possible distance between the first and last camels in the line when the camels cross the bridge without it collapsing.

-----Sample Input-----
3 2
1 4 2
10 4
2 6

-----Sample Output-----
10

 - It is possible to make the camels cross the bridge without it collapsing by, for example, arranging them in the order 1, 3, 2 from front to back, and setting the distances between them to be 0, 10.
 - For Part 1 of the bridge, there are moments when only Camel 1 and 3 are inside the part and moments when only Camel 2 is inside the part. In both cases, the sum of the weights of camels does not exceed 4 - the weight capacity of Part 1 - so there is no collapse.
 - For Part 2 of the bridge, there are moments when only Camel 1 and 3 are inside the part and moments when only Camel 2 is inside the part. In both cases, the sum of the weights of camels does not exceed 6 - the weight capacity of Part 2 - so there is no collapse.
 - Note that the distance between two camels may be 0 and that camels on endpoints of a part are not considered to be inside the part.

Pile up herbs and incense, and arise again from the flames and ashes of its predecessor — as is known to many, the phoenix does it like this.

The phoenix has a rather long lifespan, and reincarnates itself once every a! years. Here a! denotes the factorial of integer a, that is, a! = 1 × 2 × ... × a. Specifically, 0! = 1.

Koyomi doesn't care much about this, but before he gets into another mess with oddities, he is interested in the number of times the phoenix will reincarnate in a timespan of b! years, that is, [Image]. Note that when b ≥ a this value is always integer.

As the answer can be quite large, it would be enough for Koyomi just to know the last digit of the answer in decimal representation. And you're here to provide Koyomi with this knowledge.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Output one line containing a single decimal digit — the last digit of the value that interests Koyomi.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 4

Output
2

Input
0 10

Output
0

Input
107 109

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example, the last digit of $\frac{4 !}{2 !} = 12$ is 2;

In the second example, the last digit of $\frac{10 !}{0 !} = 3628800$ is 0;

In the third example, the last digit of $\frac{109 !}{107 !} = 11772$ is 2.

QUESTION:
A frog lives on the axis Ox and needs to reach home which is in the point n. She starts from the point 1. The frog can jump to the right at a distance not more than d. So, after she jumped from the point x she can reach the point x + a, where a is an integer from 1 to d.

For each point from 1 to n is known if there is a lily flower in it. The frog can jump only in points with a lilies. Guaranteed that there are lilies in the points 1 and n.

Determine the minimal number of jumps that the frog needs to reach home which is in the point n from the point 1. Consider that initially the frog is in the point 1. If the frog can not reach home, print -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) — the point, which the frog wants to reach, and the maximal length of the frog jump.

The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of zeros and ones. If a character of the string s equals to zero, then in the corresponding point there is no lily flower. In the other case, in the corresponding point there is a lily flower. Guaranteed that the first and the last characters of the string s equal to one.


-----Output-----

If the frog can not reach the home, print -1.

In the other case, print the minimal number of jumps that the frog needs to reach the home which is in the point n from the point 1.

-----Note-----

In the first example the from can reach home in two jumps: the first jump from the point 1 to the point 4 (the length of the jump is three), and the second jump from the point 4 to the point 8 (the length of the jump is four).

In the second example the frog can not reach home, because to make it she need to jump on a distance three, but the maximum length of her jump equals to two.

QUESTION:
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: ""There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number"".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

QUESTION:
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

QUESTION:
The teacher gave Anton a large geometry homework, but he didn't do it (as usual) as he participated in a regular round on Codeforces. In the task he was given a set of n lines defined by the equations y = k_{i}·x + b_{i}. It was necessary to determine whether there is at least one point of intersection of two of these lines, that lays strictly inside the strip between x_1 < x_2. In other words, is it true that there are 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and x', y', such that:   y' = k_{i} * x' + b_{i}, that is, point (x', y') belongs to the line number i;  y' = k_{j} * x' + b_{j}, that is, point (x', y') belongs to the line number j;  x_1 < x' < x_2, that is, point (x', y') lies inside the strip bounded by x_1 < x_2. 

You can't leave Anton in trouble, can you? Write a program that solves the given task.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of lines in the task given to Anton. The second line contains integers x_1 and x_2 ( - 1 000 000 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 1 000 000) defining the strip inside which you need to find a point of intersection of at least two lines.

The following n lines contain integers k_{i}, b_{i} ( - 1 000 000 ≤ k_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 1 000 000) — the descriptions of the lines. It is guaranteed that all lines are pairwise distinct, that is, for any two i ≠ j it is true that either k_{i} ≠ k_{j}, or b_{i} ≠ b_{j}.


-----Output-----

Print ""Yes"" (without quotes), if there is at least one intersection of two distinct lines, located strictly inside the strip. Otherwise print ""No"" (without quotes).

QUESTION:
Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.

QUESTION:
Maxim wants to buy an apartment in a new house at Line Avenue of Metropolis. The house has n apartments that are numbered from 1 to n and are arranged in a row. Two apartments are adjacent if their indices differ by 1. Some of the apartments can already be inhabited, others are available for sale.

Maxim often visits his neighbors, so apartment is good for him if it is available for sale and there is at least one already inhabited apartment adjacent to it. Maxim knows that there are exactly k already inhabited apartments, but he doesn't know their indices yet.

Find out what could be the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments that are good for Maxim.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers: n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments good for Maxim.


-----Example-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 3



-----Note-----

In the sample test, the number of good apartments could be minimum possible if, for example, apartments with indices 1, 2 and 3 were inhabited. In this case only apartment 4 is good. The maximum possible number could be, for example, if apartments with indices 1, 3 and 5 were inhabited. In this case all other apartments: 2, 4 and 6 are good.

QUESTION:
Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.

QUESTION:
Tonio has a keyboard with only two letters, ""V"" and ""K"".

One day, he has typed out a string s with only these two letters. He really likes it when the string ""VK"" appears, so he wishes to change at most one letter in the string (or do no changes) to maximize the number of occurrences of that string. Compute the maximum number of times ""VK"" can appear as a substring (i. e. a letter ""K"" right after a letter ""V"") in the resulting string.


-----Input-----

The first line will contain a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters ""V"" and ""K"" with length not less than 1 and not greater than 100.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the maximum number of times ""VK"" can appear as a substring of the given string after changing at most one character.


-----Examples-----
Input
VK

Output
1

Input
VV

Output
1

Input
V

Output
0

Input
VKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK

Output
3

Input
KVKV

Output
1



-----Note-----

For the first case, we do not change any letters. ""VK"" appears once, which is the maximum number of times it could appear.

For the second case, we can change the second character from a ""V"" to a ""K"". This will give us the string ""VK"". This has one occurrence of the string ""VK"" as a substring.

For the fourth case, we can change the fourth character from a ""K"" to a ""V"". This will give us the string ""VKKVKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK"". This has three occurrences of the string ""VK"" as a substring. We can check no other moves can give us strictly more occurrences.

QUESTION:
Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

QUESTION:
Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.

QUESTION:
Amr bought a new video game ""Guess Your Way Out!"". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string ""LRLRLRLRL..."" (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means ""go to the left child of the current node"";  Character 'R' means ""go to the right child of the current node"";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

QUESTION:
Spongebob is already tired trying to reason his weird actions and calculations, so he simply asked you to find all pairs of n and m, such that there are exactly x distinct squares in the table consisting of n rows and m columns. For example, in a 3 × 5 table there are 15 squares with side one, 8 squares with side two and 3 squares with side three. The total number of distinct squares in a 3 × 5 table is 15 + 8 + 3 = 26.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the number of squares inside the tables Spongebob is interested in.


-----Output-----

First print a single integer k — the number of tables with exactly x distinct squares inside.

Then print k pairs of integers describing the tables. Print the pairs in the order of increasing n, and in case of equality — in the order of increasing m.


-----Examples-----
Input

QUESTION:
Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.

A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.

In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check.


-----Output-----

If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print ""YES"" (without quotes). Otherwise, print ""NO"" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
31 31 30 31

Output
Yes


Input
2
30 30

Output
No


Input
5
29 31 30 31 30

Output
Yes


Input
3
31 28 30

Output
No


Input
3
31 31 28

Output
Yes




-----Note-----

In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.

In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.

In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.

In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print ""YES"" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or ""NO"" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.

QUESTION:
Vasya should paint a fence in front of his own cottage. The fence is a sequence of n wooden boards arranged in a single row. Each board is a 1 centimeter wide rectangle. Let's number the board fence using numbers 1, 2, ..., n from left to right. The height of the i-th board is h_{i} centimeters.

Vasya has a 1 centimeter wide brush and the paint of two colors, red and green. Of course, the amount of the paint is limited. Vasya counted the area he can paint each of the colors. It turned out that he can not paint over a square centimeters of the fence red, and he can not paint over b square centimeters green. Each board of the fence should be painted exactly one of the two colors. Perhaps Vasya won't need one of the colors.

In addition, Vasya wants his fence to look smart. To do this, he should paint the fence so as to minimize the value that Vasya called the fence unattractiveness value. Vasya believes that two consecutive fence boards, painted different colors, look unattractive. The unattractiveness value of a fence is the total length of contact between the neighboring boards of various colors. To make the fence look nice, you need to minimize the value as low as possible. Your task is to find what is the minimum unattractiveness Vasya can get, if he paints his fence completely. $1$ 

The picture shows the fence, where the heights of boards (from left to right) are 2,3,2,4,3,1. The first and the fifth boards are painted red, the others are painted green. The first and the second boards have contact length 2, the fourth and fifth boards have contact length 3, the fifth and the sixth have contact length 1. Therefore, the unattractiveness of the given painted fence is 2+3+1=6.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of boards in Vasya's fence.

The second line contains two integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 4·10^4) — the area that can be painted red and the area that can be painted green, correspondingly.

The third line contains a sequence of n integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 200) — the heights of the fence boards.

All numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the minimum unattractiveness value Vasya can get if he paints his fence completely. If it is impossible to do, print  - 1.

QUESTION:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print ""NO"".

Otherwise print ""YES"" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

QUESTION:
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print ""YES"" (without quotes), otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

QUESTION:
Greg is a beginner bodybuilder. Today the gym coach gave him the training plan. All it had was n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. These numbers mean that Greg needs to do exactly n exercises today. Besides, Greg should repeat the i-th in order exercise a_{i} times.

Greg now only does three types of exercises: ""chest"" exercises, ""biceps"" exercises and ""back"" exercises. Besides, his training is cyclic, that is, the first exercise he does is a ""chest"" one, the second one is ""biceps"", the third one is ""back"", the fourth one is ""chest"", the fifth one is ""biceps"", and so on to the n-th exercise.

Now Greg wonders, which muscle will get the most exercise during his training. We know that the exercise Greg repeats the maximum number of times, trains the corresponding muscle the most. Help Greg, determine which muscle will get the most training.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 25) — the number of times Greg repeats the exercises.


-----Output-----

Print word ""chest"" (without the quotes), if the chest gets the most exercise, ""biceps"" (without the quotes), if the biceps gets the most exercise and print ""back"" (without the quotes) if the back gets the most exercise.

It is guaranteed that the input is such that the answer to the problem is unambiguous.

In the first sample Greg does 2 chest, 8 biceps and zero back exercises, so the biceps gets the most exercises.

In the second sample Greg does 5 chest, 1 biceps and 10 back exercises, so the back gets the most exercises.

In the third sample Greg does 18 chest, 12 biceps and 8 back exercises, so the chest gets the most exercise.

QUESTION:
Translator's note: in Russia's most widespread grading system, there are four grades: 5, 4, 3, 2, the higher the better, roughly corresponding to A, B, C and F respectively in American grading system.

The term is coming to an end and students start thinking about their grades. Today, a professor told his students that the grades for his course would be given out automatically  — he would calculate the simple average (arithmetic mean) of all grades given out for lab works this term and round to the nearest integer. The rounding would be done in favour of the student — $4.5$ would be rounded up to $5$ (as in example 3), but $4.4$ would be rounded down to $4$.

This does not bode well for Vasya who didn't think those lab works would influence anything, so he may receive a grade worse than $5$ (maybe even the dreaded $2$). However, the professor allowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya's choosing to increase his average grade. Vasya wants to redo as as few lab works as possible in order to get $5$ for the course. Of course, Vasya will get $5$ for the lab works he chooses to redo.

Help Vasya — calculate the minimum amount of lab works Vasya has to redo.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ — the number of Vasya's grades ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The second line contains $n$ integers from $2$ to $5$ — Vasya's grades for his lab works.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimum amount of lab works that Vasya has to redo. It can be shown that Vasya can always redo enough lab works to get a $5$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
4 4 4

Output
2

Input
4
5 4 5 5

Output
0

Input
4
5 3 3 5

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, it is enough to redo two lab works to make two $4$s into $5$s.

In the second sample, Vasya's average is already $4.75$ so he doesn't have to redo anything to get a $5$.

In the second sample Vasya has to redo one lab work to get rid of one of the $3$s, that will make the average exactly $4.5$ so the final grade would be $5$.

QUESTION:
Captain Bill the Hummingbird and his crew recieved an interesting challenge offer. Some stranger gave them a map, potion of teleportation and said that only this potion might help them to reach the treasure. 

Bottle with potion has two values x and y written on it. These values define four moves which can be performed using the potion:

  $(a, b) \rightarrow(a + x, b + y)$  $(a, b) \rightarrow(a + x, b - y)$  $(a, b) \rightarrow(a - x, b + y)$  $(a, b) \rightarrow(a - x, b - y)$ 

Map shows that the position of Captain Bill the Hummingbird is (x_1, y_1) and the position of the treasure is (x_2, y_2).

You task is to tell Captain Bill the Hummingbird whether he should accept this challenge or decline. If it is possible for Captain to reach the treasure using the potion then output ""YES"", otherwise ""NO"" (without quotes).

The potion can be used infinite amount of times.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 10^5 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^5) — positions of Captain Bill the Hummingbird and treasure respectively.

The second line contains two integer numbers x, y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^5) — values on the potion bottle.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if it is possible for Captain to reach the treasure using the potion, otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).

QUESTION:
This night wasn't easy on Vasya. His favorite team lost, and he didn't find himself victorious either — although he played perfectly, his teammates let him down every time. He had to win at least one more time, but the losestreak only grew longer and longer... It's no wonder he didn't get any sleep this night at all.

In the morning, Vasya was waiting the bus to the university on the bus stop. Vasya's thoughts were hazy and so he couldn't remember the right bus' number quite right and got onto the bus with the number $n$.

In the bus, Vasya thought that he could get the order of the digits in the number of the bus wrong. Futhermore, he could ""see"" some digits several times, but the digits he saw were definitely in the real number of the bus. For example, if Vasya saw the number 2028, it could mean that the real bus number could be 2028, 8022, 2820 or just 820. However, numbers 80, 22208, 52 definitely couldn't be the number of the bus. Also, real bus number couldn't start with the digit 0, this meaning that, for example, number 082 couldn't be the real bus number too.

Given $n$, determine the total number of possible bus number variants.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the number of the bus that was seen by Vasya. It is guaranteed that this number does not start with $0$.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the amount of possible variants of the real bus number.


-----Examples-----
Input
97

Output
2

Input
2028

Output
13



-----Note-----

In the first sample, only variants $97$ and $79$ are possible.

In the second sample, the variants (in the increasing order) are the following: $208$, $280$, $802$, $820$, $2028$, $2082$, $2208$, $2280$, $2802$, $2820$, $8022$, $8202$, $8220$.

QUESTION:
A new delivery of clothing has arrived today to the clothing store. This delivery consists of $a$ ties, $b$ scarves, $c$ vests and $d$ jackets.

The store does not sell single clothing items — instead, it sells suits of two types:  a suit of the first type consists of one tie and one jacket;  a suit of the second type consists of one scarf, one vest and one jacket. 

Each suit of the first type costs $e$ coins, and each suit of the second type costs $f$ coins.

Calculate the maximum possible cost of a set of suits that can be composed from the delivered clothing items. Note that one item cannot be used in more than one suit (though some items may be left unused).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $a$ $(1 \le a \le 100\,000)$ — the number of ties.

The second line contains one integer $b$ $(1 \le b \le 100\,000)$ — the number of scarves.

The third line contains one integer $c$ $(1 \le c \le 100\,000)$ — the number of vests.

The fourth line contains one integer $d$ $(1 \le d \le 100\,000)$ — the number of jackets.

The fifth line contains one integer $e$ $(1 \le e \le 1\,000)$ — the cost of one suit of the first type.

The sixth line contains one integer $f$ $(1 \le f \le 1\,000)$ — the cost of one suit of the second type.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum total cost of some set of suits that can be composed from the delivered items.

-----Note-----

It is possible to compose three suits of the second type in the first example, and their total cost will be $6$. Since all jackets will be used, it's impossible to add anything to this set.

The best course of action in the second example is to compose nine suits of the first type and eleven suits of the second type. The total cost is $9 \cdot 4 + 11 \cdot 6 = 102$.

QUESTION:
Recently Anton found a box with digits in his room. There are k_2 digits 2, k_3 digits 3, k_5 digits 5 and k_6 digits 6.

Anton's favorite integers are 32 and 256. He decided to compose this integers from digits he has. He wants to make the sum of these integers as large as possible. Help him solve this task!

Each digit can be used no more than once, i.e. the composed integers should contain no more than k_2 digits 2, k_3 digits 3 and so on. Of course, unused digits are not counted in the sum.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains four integers k_2, k_3, k_5 and k_6 — the number of digits 2, 3, 5 and 6 respectively (0 ≤ k_2, k_3, k_5, k_6 ≤ 5·10^6).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — maximum possible sum of Anton's favorite integers that can be composed using digits from the box.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 1 3 4

Output
800

Input
1 1 1 1

Output
256



-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are five digits 2, one digit 3, three digits 5 and four digits 6. Anton can compose three integers 256 and one integer 32 to achieve the value 256 + 256 + 256 + 32 = 800. Note, that there is one unused integer 2 and one unused integer 6. They are not counted in the answer.

In the second sample, the optimal answer is to create on integer 256, thus the answer is 256.

QUESTION:
Mr. Bender has a digital table of size n × n, each cell can be switched on or off. He wants the field to have at least c switched on squares. When this condition is fulfilled, Mr Bender will be happy.

We'll consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 to n, and the columns — numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Initially there is exactly one switched on cell with coordinates (x, y) (x is the row number, y is the column number), and all other cells are switched off. Then each second we switch on the cells that are off but have the side-adjacent cells that are on.

For a cell with coordinates (x, y) the side-adjacent cells are cells with coordinates (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x, y + 1).

In how many seconds will Mr. Bender get happy?


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, x, y, c (1 ≤ n, c ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; c ≤ n^2).


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 4 3 1

Output
0

Input
9 3 8 10

Output
2



-----Note-----

Initially the first test has one painted cell, so the answer is 0. In the second test all events will go as is shown on the figure. [Image].

QUESTION:
A little girl loves problems on bitwise operations very much. Here's one of them.

You are given two integers l and r. Let's consider the values of $a \oplus b$ for all pairs of integers a and b (l ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r). Your task is to find the maximum value among all considered ones.

Expression $x \oplus y$ means applying bitwise excluding or operation to integers x and y. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented as ""^"", in Pascal — as «xor».


-----Input-----

The single line contains space-separated integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18).

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single integer — the maximum value of $a \oplus b$ for all pairs of integers a, b (l ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r).

QUESTION:
You are given a set of $2n+1$ integer points on a Cartesian plane. Points are numbered from $0$ to $2n$ inclusive. Let $P_i$ be the $i$-th point. The $x$-coordinate of the point $P_i$ equals $i$. The $y$-coordinate of the point $P_i$ equals zero (initially). Thus, initially $P_i=(i,0)$.

The given points are vertices of a plot of a piecewise function. The $j$-th piece of the function is the segment $P_{j}P_{j + 1}$.

In one move you can increase the $y$-coordinate of any point with odd $x$-coordinate (i.e. such points are $P_1, P_3, \dots, P_{2n-1}$) by $1$. Note that the corresponding segments also change.

For example, the following plot shows a function for $n=3$ (i.e. number of points is $2\cdot3+1=7$) in which we increased the $y$-coordinate of the point $P_1$ three times and $y$-coordinate of the point $P_5$ one time: [Image] 

Let the area of the plot be the area below this plot and above the coordinate axis OX. For example, the area of the plot on the picture above is 4 (the light blue area on the picture above is the area of the plot drawn on it).

Let the height of the plot be the maximum $y$-coordinate among all initial points in the plot (i.e. points $P_0, P_1, \dots, P_{2n}$). The height of the plot on the picture above is 3.

Your problem is to say which minimum possible height can have the plot consisting of $2n+1$ vertices and having an area equal to $k$. Note that it is unnecessary to minimize the number of moves.

It is easy to see that any answer which can be obtained by performing moves described above always exists and is an integer number not exceeding $10^{18}$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}$) — the number of vertices in a plot of a piecewise function and the area we need to obtain.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible height of a plot consisting of $2n+1$ vertices and with an area equals $k$. It is easy to see that any answer which can be obtained by performing moves described above always exists and is an integer number not exceeding $10^{18}$.

-----Note-----

One of the possible answers to the first example: [Image] 

The area of this plot is 3, the height of this plot is 1.

There is only one possible answer to the second example: $M M$ 

The area of this plot is 12, the height of this plot is 3.

QUESTION:
Masha lives in a multi-storey building, where floors are numbered with positive integers. Two floors are called adjacent if their numbers differ by one. Masha decided to visit Egor. Masha lives on the floor $x$, Egor on the floor $y$ (not on the same floor with Masha).

The house has a staircase and an elevator. If Masha uses the stairs, it takes $t_1$ seconds for her to walk between adjacent floors (in each direction). The elevator passes between adjacent floors (in each way) in $t_2$ seconds. The elevator moves with doors closed. The elevator spends $t_3$ seconds to open or close the doors. We can assume that time is not spent on any action except moving between adjacent floors and waiting for the doors to open or close. If Masha uses the elevator, it immediately goes directly to the desired floor.

Coming out of the apartment on her floor, Masha noticed that the elevator is now on the floor $z$ and has closed doors. Now she has to choose whether to use the stairs or use the elevator. 

If the time that Masha needs to get to the Egor's floor by the stairs is strictly less than the time it will take her using the elevator, then she will use the stairs, otherwise she will choose the elevator.

Help Mary to understand whether to use the elevator or the stairs.


-----Input-----

The only line contains six integers $x$, $y$, $z$, $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ ($1 \leq x, y, z, t_1, t_2, t_3 \leq 1000$) — the floor Masha is at, the floor Masha wants to get to, the floor the elevator is located on, the time it takes Masha to pass between two floors by stairs, the time it takes the elevator to pass between two floors and the time it takes for the elevator to close or open the doors.

It is guaranteed that $x \ne y$.


-----Output-----

If the time it will take to use the elevator is not greater than the time it will take to use the stairs, print «YES» (without quotes), otherwise print «NO> (without quotes).

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 1 4 4 2 1

Output
YES
Input
1 6 6 2 1 1

Output
NO
Input
4 1 7 4 1 2

Output
YES


-----Note-----

In the first example:

If Masha goes by the stairs, the time she spends is $4 \cdot 4 = 16$, because she has to go $4$ times between adjacent floors and each time she spends $4$ seconds. 

If she chooses the elevator, she will have to wait $2$ seconds while the elevator leaves the $4$-th floor and goes to the $5$-th. After that the doors will be opening for another $1$ second. Then Masha will enter the elevator, and she will have to wait for $1$ second for the doors closing. Next, the elevator will spend $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ seconds going from the $5$-th floor to the $1$-st, because the elevator has to pass $4$ times between adjacent floors and spends $2$ seconds each time. And finally, it will take another $1$ second before the doors are open and Masha can come out. 

Thus, all the way by elevator will take $2 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 13$ seconds, which is less than $16$ seconds, so Masha has to choose the elevator.

In the second example, it is more profitable for Masha to use the stairs, because it will take $13$ seconds to use the elevator, that is more than the $10$ seconds it will takes to go by foot.

In the third example, the time it takes to use the elevator is equal to the time it takes to walk up by the stairs, and is equal to $12$ seconds. That means Masha will take the elevator.

QUESTION:
One day Misha and Andrew were playing a very simple game. First, each player chooses an integer in the range from 1 to n. Let's assume that Misha chose number m, and Andrew chose number a.

Then, by using a random generator they choose a random integer c in the range between 1 and n (any integer from 1 to n is chosen with the same probability), after which the winner is the player, whose number was closer to c. The boys agreed that if m and a are located on the same distance from c, Misha wins.

Andrew wants to win very much, so he asks you to help him. You know the number selected by Misha, and number n. You need to determine which value of a Andrew must choose, so that the probability of his victory is the highest possible.

More formally, you need to find such integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n), that the probability that $|c - a|<|c - m|$ is maximal, where c is the equiprobably chosen integer from 1 to n (inclusive).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the range of numbers in the game, and the number selected by Misha respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — such value a, that probability that Andrew wins is the highest. If there are multiple such values, print the minimum of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 1

Output
2
Input
4 3

Output
2


-----Note-----

In the first sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 2 or 3. The probability that Andrew wins is 2 / 3. If Andrew chooses a = 3, the probability of winning will be 1 / 3. If a = 1, the probability of winning is 0.

In the second sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 1 and 2. The probability that Andrew wins is 1 / 2. For other choices of a the probability of winning is less.

QUESTION:
Alena has successfully passed the entrance exams to the university and is now looking forward to start studying.

One two-hour lesson at the Russian university is traditionally called a pair, it lasts for two academic hours (an academic hour is equal to 45 minutes).

The University works in such a way that every day it holds exactly n lessons. Depending on the schedule of a particular group of students, on a given day, some pairs may actually contain classes, but some may be empty (such pairs are called breaks).

The official website of the university has already published the schedule for tomorrow for Alena's group. Thus, for each of the n pairs she knows if there will be a class at that time or not.

Alena's House is far from the university, so if there are breaks, she doesn't always go home. Alena has time to go home only if the break consists of at least two free pairs in a row, otherwise she waits for the next pair at the university.

Of course, Alena does not want to be sleepy during pairs, so she will sleep as long as possible, and will only come to the first pair that is presented in her schedule. Similarly, if there are no more pairs, then Alena immediately goes home.

Alena appreciates the time spent at home, so she always goes home when it is possible, and returns to the university only at the beginning of the next pair. Help Alena determine for how many pairs she will stay at the university. Note that during some pairs Alena may be at the university waiting for the upcoming pair.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of lessons at the university. 

The second line contains n numbers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1). Number a_{i} equals 0, if Alena doesn't have the i-th pairs, otherwise it is equal to 1. Numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are separated by spaces.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the number of pairs during which Alena stays at the university.

In the last sample Alena doesn't have a single pair, so she spends all the time at home.

QUESTION:
Bran and his older sister Arya are from the same house. Bran like candies so much, so Arya is going to give him some Candies.

At first, Arya and Bran have 0 Candies. There are n days, at the i-th day, Arya finds a_{i} candies in a box, that is given by the Many-Faced God. Every day she can give Bran at most 8 of her candies. If she don't give him the candies at the same day, they are saved for her and she can give them to him later.

Your task is to find the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day. Formally, you need to output the minimum day index to the end of which k candies will be given out (the days are indexed from 1 to n).

Print -1 if she can't give him k candies during n given days.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Arya to give Bran k candies within n days, print -1.

Otherwise print a single integer — the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day.


-----Examples-----
Input

1 2

Output

Input
3 17
10 10 10

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Arya can give Bran 3 candies in 2 days.

In the second sample, Arya can give Bran 17 candies in 3 days, because she can give him at most 8 candies per day.

In the third sample, Arya can't give Bran 9 candies, because she can give him at most 8 candies per day and she must give him the candies within 1 day.

QUESTION:
Recently a dog was bought for Polycarp. The dog's name is Cormen. Now Polycarp has a lot of troubles. For example, Cormen likes going for a walk. 

Empirically Polycarp learned that the dog needs at least k walks for any two consecutive days in order to feel good. For example, if k = 5 and yesterday Polycarp went for a walk with Cormen 2 times, today he has to go for a walk at least 3 times. 

Polycarp analysed all his affairs over the next n days and made a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} is the number of times Polycarp will walk with the dog on the i-th day while doing all his affairs (for example, he has to go to a shop, throw out the trash, etc.).

Help Polycarp determine the minimum number of walks he needs to do additionaly in the next n days so that Cormen will feel good during all the n days. You can assume that on the day before the first day and on the day after the n-th day Polycarp will go for a walk with Cormen exactly k times. 

Write a program that will find the minumum number of additional walks and the appropriate schedule — the sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (b_{i} ≥ a_{i}), where b_{i} means the total number of walks with the dog on the i-th day.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 500) — the number of days and the minimum number of walks with Cormen for any two consecutive days. 

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 500) — the number of walks with Cormen on the i-th day which Polycarp has already planned. 


-----Output-----

In the first line print the smallest number of additional walks that Polycarp should do during the next n days so that Cormen will feel good during all days. 

In the second line print n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, where b_{i} — the total number of walks on the i-th day according to the found solutions (a_{i} ≤ b_{i} for all i from 1 to n). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

QUESTION:
While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a $n$-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A $1$-st order rhombus is just a square $1 \times 1$ (i.e just a cell).

A $n$-th order rhombus for all $n \geq 2$ one obtains from a $n-1$-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

 [Image] 

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a $n$-th order rhombus.


-----Input-----

The first and only input line contains integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Input
1

Output
1
Input
2

Output
5

QUESTION:
You are given n switches and m lamps. The i-th switch turns on some subset of the lamps. This information is given as the matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns where a_{i}, j = 1 if the i-th switch turns on the j-th lamp and a_{i}, j = 0 if the i-th switch is not connected to the j-th lamp.

Initially all m lamps are turned off.

Switches change state only from ""off"" to ""on"". It means that if you press two or more switches connected to the same lamp then the lamp will be turned on after any of this switches is pressed and will remain its state even if any switch connected to this lamp is pressed afterwards.

It is guaranteed that if you push all n switches then all m lamps will be turned on.

Your think that you have too many switches and you would like to ignore one of them. 

Your task is to say if there exists such a switch that if you will ignore (not use) it but press all the other n - 1 switches then all the m lamps will be turned on.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) — the number of the switches and the number of the lamps.

The following n lines contain m characters each. The character a_{i}, j is equal to '1' if the i-th switch turns on the j-th lamp and '0' otherwise.

It is guaranteed that if you press all n switches all m lamps will be turned on.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if there is a switch that if you will ignore it and press all the other n - 1 switches then all m lamps will be turned on. Print ""NO"" if there is no such switch.

QUESTION:
Valera has got n domino pieces in a row. Each piece consists of two halves — the upper one and the lower one. Each of the halves contains a number from 1 to 6. Valera loves even integers very much, so he wants the sum of the numbers on the upper halves and the sum of the numbers on the lower halves to be even.

To do that, Valera can rotate the dominoes by 180 degrees. After the rotation the upper and the lower halves swap places. This action takes one second. Help Valera find out the minimum time he must spend rotating dominoes to make his wish come true.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), denoting the number of dominoes Valera has. Next n lines contain two space-separated integers x_{i}, y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 6). Number x_{i} is initially written on the upper half of the i-th domino, y_{i} is initially written on the lower half.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the minimum required number of seconds. If Valera can't do the task in any time, print  - 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
4 2
6 4

Output
0

Input
1
2 3

Output
-1

Input
3
1 4
2 3
4 4

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first test case the sum of the numbers on the upper halves equals 10 and the sum of the numbers on the lower halves equals 6. Both numbers are even, so Valera doesn't required to do anything.

In the second sample Valera has only one piece of domino. It is written 3 on the one of its halves, therefore one of the sums will always be odd.

In the third case Valera can rotate the first piece, and after that the sum on the upper halves will be equal to 10, and the sum on the lower halves will be equal to 8.

QUESTION:
Alice has a lovely piece of cloth. It has the shape of a square with a side of length $a$ centimeters. Bob also wants such piece of cloth. He would prefer a square with a side of length $b$ centimeters (where $b < a$). Alice wanted to make Bob happy, so she cut the needed square out of the corner of her piece and gave it to Bob. Now she is left with an ugly L shaped cloth (see pictures below).

Alice would like to know whether the area of her cloth expressed in square centimeters is prime. Could you help her to determine it?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a number $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 5$) — the number of test cases.

Each of the next $t$ lines describes the $i$-th test case. It contains two integers $a$ and $b~(1 \leq b < a \leq 10^{11})$ — the side length of Alice's square and the side length of the square that Bob wants.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ lines, where the $i$-th line is the answer to the $i$-th test case. Print ""YES"" (without quotes) if the area of the remaining piece of cloth is prime, otherwise print ""NO"".

You can print each letter in an arbitrary case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
6 5
16 13
61690850361 24777622630
34 33

Output
YES
NO
NO
YES



-----Note-----

The figure below depicts the first test case. The blue part corresponds to the piece which belongs to Bob, and the red part is the piece that Alice keeps for herself. The area of the red part is $6^2 - 5^2 = 36 - 25 = 11$, which is prime, so the answer is ""YES"". [Image] 

In the second case, the area is $16^2 - 13^2 = 87$, which is divisible by $3$. [Image] 

In the third case, the area of the remaining piece is $61690850361^2 - 24777622630^2 = 3191830435068605713421$. This number is not prime because $3191830435068605713421 = 36913227731 \cdot 86468472991 $.

In the last case, the area is $34^2 - 33^2 = 67$.

QUESTION:
Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vičkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vičkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!

Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers A and B and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers ""A factorial"" and ""B factorial"". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(A!, B!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer x is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to x. Thus x! = 1·2·3·...·(x - 1)·x. For example 4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24. Recall that GCD(x, y) is the largest positive integer q that divides (without a remainder) both x and y.

Leha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?


-----Input-----

The first and single line contains two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^9, min(A, B) ≤ 12).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor of integers A! and B!.


-----Example-----
Input
4 3

Output
6



-----Note-----

Consider the sample.

4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24. 3! = 1·2·3 = 6. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and 6 is exactly 6.

QUESTION:
Let's call a positive integer composite if it has at least one divisor other than $1$ and itself. For example:

  the following numbers are composite: $1024$, $4$, $6$, $9$;  the following numbers are not composite: $13$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $37$. 

You are given a positive integer $n$. Find two composite integers $a,b$ such that $a-b=n$.

It can be proven that solution always exists.


-----Input-----

The input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^7$): the given integer.


-----Output-----

Print two composite integers $a,b$ ($2 \leq a, b \leq 10^9, a-b=n$).

It can be proven, that solution always exists.

QUESTION:
There is a directed graph with N vertices numbered 1 to N and M edges.
The i-th edge is directed from Vertex A_i to Vertex B_i, and there are C_i coins placed along that edge.
Additionally, there is a button on Vertex N.
We will play a game on this graph.
You start the game on Vertex 1 with zero coins, and head for Vertex N by traversing the edges while collecting coins.
It takes one minute to traverse an edge, and you can collect the coins placed along the edge each time you traverse it.
As usual in games, even if you traverse an edge once and collect the coins, the same number of coins will reappear next time you traverse that edge, which you can collect again.
When you reach Vertex N, you can end the game by pressing the button. (You can also choose to leave Vertex N without pressing the button and continue traveling.)
However, when you end the game, you will be asked to pay T \times P coins, where T is the number of minutes elapsed since the start of the game. If you have less than T \times P coins, you will have to pay all of your coins instead.
Your score will be the number of coins you have after this payment.
Determine if there exists a maximum value of the score that can be obtained. If the answer is yes, find that maximum value.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2500
 - 1 \leq M \leq 5000
 - 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N
 - 1 \leq C_i \leq 10^5
 - 0 \leq P \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.
 - Vertex N can be reached from Vertex 1.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M P
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_M B_M C_M

-----Output-----
If there exists a maximum value of the score that can be obtained, print that maximum value; otherwise, print -1.

-----Sample Input-----
3 3 10
1 2 20
2 3 30
1 3 45

-----Sample Output-----
35


There are two ways to travel from Vertex 1 to Vertex 3:
 - Vertex 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3: You collect 20 + 30 = 50 coins on the way. After two minutes from the start of the game, you press the button, pay 2 \times 10 = 20 coins, and you have 50 - 20 = 30 coins left.
 - Vertex 1 \rightarrow 2: You collect 45 coins on the way. After one minute from the start of the game, you press the button, pay 1 \times 10 = 10 coins, and you have 45 - 10 = 35 coins left.
Thus, the maximum score that can be obtained is 35.

QUESTION:
We have N strings of lowercase English letters: S_1, S_2, \cdots, S_N.
Takahashi wants to make a string that is a palindrome by choosing one or more of these strings - the same string can be chosen more than once - and concatenating them in some order of his choice.
The cost of using the string S_i once is C_i, and the cost of using it multiple times is C_i multiplied by that number of times.
Find the minimum total cost needed to choose strings so that Takahashi can make a palindrome.
If there is no choice of strings in which he can make a palindrome, print -1.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 50
 - 1 \leq |S_i| \leq 20
 - S_i consists of lowercase English letters.
 - 1 \leq C_i \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1 C_1
S_2 C_2
:
S_N C_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total cost needed to choose strings so that Takahashi can make a palindrome, or -1 if there is no such choice.

-----Sample Input-----
3
ba 3
abc 4
cbaa 5

-----Sample Output-----
7

We have ba, abc, and cbaa.
For example, we can use ba once and abc once for a cost of 7, then concatenate them in the order abc, ba to make a palindrome.
Also, we can use abc once and cbaa once for a cost of 9, then concatenate them in the order cbaa, abc to make a palindrome.
We cannot make a palindrome for a cost less than 7, so we should print 7.

QUESTION:
Since Grisha behaved well last year, at New Year's Eve he was visited by Ded Moroz who brought an enormous bag of gifts with him! The bag contains n sweet candies from the good ol' bakery, each labeled from 1 to n corresponding to its tastiness. No two candies have the same tastiness.

The choice of candies has a direct effect on Grisha's happiness. One can assume that he should take the tastiest ones — but no, the holiday magic turns things upside down. It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!

A xor-sum of a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: $a_{1} \oplus a_{2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{m}$, here $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found here.

Ded Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than k candies from the bag. Help Grisha determine the largest xor-sum (largest xor-sum means maximum happiness!) he can obtain.


-----Input-----

The sole string contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Output one number — the largest possible xor-sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3

Output
7

Input
6 6

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first sample case, one optimal answer is 1, 2 and 4, giving the xor-sum of 7.

In the second sample case, one can, for example, take all six candies and obtain the xor-sum of 7.

QUESTION:
There are $n$ points on the plane, $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \ldots, (x_n,y_n)$.

You need to place an isosceles triangle with two sides on the coordinate axis to cover all points (a point is covered if it lies inside the triangle or on the side of the triangle). Calculate the minimum length of the shorter side of the triangle.


-----Input-----

First line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$).

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \leq x_i,y_i \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum length of the shorter side of the triangle. It can be proved that it's always an integer.

QUESTION:
Alice likes word ""nineteen"" very much. She has a string s and wants the string to contain as many such words as possible. For that reason she can rearrange the letters of the string.

For example, if she has string ""xiineteenppnnnewtnee"", she can get string ""xnineteenppnineteenw"", containing (the occurrences marked) two such words. More formally, word ""nineteen"" occurs in the string the number of times you can read it starting from some letter of the string. Of course, you shouldn't skip letters.

Help her to find the maximum number of ""nineteen""s that she can get in her string.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string s, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The length of string s doesn't exceed 100.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of ""nineteen""s that she can get in her string.

QUESTION:
The weather is fine today and hence it's high time to climb the nearby pine and enjoy the landscape.

The pine's trunk includes several branches, located one above another and numbered from 2 to y. Some of them (more precise, from 2 to p) are occupied by tiny vile grasshoppers which you're at war with. These grasshoppers are known for their awesome jumping skills: the grasshopper at branch x can jump to branches $2 \cdot x, 3 \cdot x, \ldots, \lfloor \frac{y}{x} \rfloor \cdot x$.

Keeping this in mind, you wisely decided to choose such a branch that none of the grasshoppers could interrupt you. At the same time you wanna settle as high as possible since the view from up there is simply breathtaking.

In other words, your goal is to find the highest branch that cannot be reached by any of the grasshoppers or report that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers p and y (2 ≤ p ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Output the number of the highest suitable branch. If there are none, print -1 instead.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 6

Output
5

Input
3 4

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample case grasshopper from branch 2 reaches branches 2, 4 and 6 while branch 3 is initially settled by another grasshopper. Therefore the answer is 5.

It immediately follows that there are no valid branches in second sample case.

QUESTION:
Zane the wizard had never loved anyone before, until he fell in love with a girl, whose name remains unknown to us.

 [Image] 

The girl lives in house m of a village. There are n houses in that village, lining in a straight line from left to right: house 1, house 2, ..., house n. The village is also well-structured: house i and house i + 1 (1 ≤ i < n) are exactly 10 meters away. In this village, some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.

You will be given n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house i is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then a_{i} equals 0. Otherwise, house i can be bought, and a_{i} represents the money required to buy it, in dollars.

As Zane has only k dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush. Help Zane determine the minimum distance from his crush's house to some house he can afford, to help him succeed in his love.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of houses in the village, the house where the girl lives, and the amount of money Zane has (in dollars), respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — denoting the availability and the prices of the houses.

It is guaranteed that a_{m} = 0 and that it is possible to purchase some house with no more than k dollars.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum distance, in meters, from the house where the girl Zane likes lives to the house Zane can buy.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, with k = 20 dollars, Zane can buy only house 5. The distance from house m = 1 to house 5 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 meters.

In the second sample, Zane can buy houses 6 and 7. It is better to buy house 6 than house 7, since house m = 3 and house 6 are only 30 meters away, while house m = 3 and house 7 are 40 meters away.

QUESTION:
Nastya came to her informatics lesson, and her teacher who is, by the way, a little bit famous here gave her the following task.

Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are given, each of them has size $n \times m$. Nastya can perform the following operation to matrix $A$ unlimited number of times:   take any square square submatrix of $A$ and transpose it (i.e. the element of the submatrix which was in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of the submatrix will be in the $j$-th row and $i$-th column after transposing, and the transposed submatrix itself will keep its place in the matrix $A$). 

Nastya's task is to check whether it is possible to transform the matrix $A$ to the matrix $B$.

 $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline 6 & {3} & {2} & {11} \\ \hline 5 & {9} & {4} & {2} \\ \hline 3 & {3} & {3} & {3} \\ \hline 4 & {8} & {2} & {2} \\ \hline 7 & {8} & {6} & {4} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ Example of the operation 

As it may require a lot of operations, you are asked to answer this question for Nastya.

A square submatrix of matrix $M$ is a matrix which consist of all elements which comes from one of the rows with indeces $x, x+1, \dots, x+k-1$ of matrix $M$ and comes from one of the columns with indeces $y, y+1, \dots, y+k-1$ of matrix $M$. $k$ is the size of square submatrix. In other words, square submatrix is the set of elements of source matrix which form a solid square (i.e. without holes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ separated by space ($1 \leq n, m \leq 500$) — the numbers of rows and columns in $A$ and $B$ respectively.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ integers, the $j$-th number in the $i$-th of these lines denotes the $j$-th element of the $i$-th row of the matrix $A$ ($1 \leq A_{ij} \leq 10^{9}$).

Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ integers, the $j$-th number in the $i$-th of these lines denotes the $j$-th element of the $i$-th row of the matrix $B$ ($1 \leq B_{ij} \leq 10^{9}$).


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (without quotes) if it is possible to transform $A$ to $B$ and ""NO"" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

-----Note-----

Consider the third example. The matrix $A$ initially looks as follows.

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3\\ 4 & 5 & 6\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{bmatrix} $$

Then we choose the whole matrix as transposed submatrix and it becomes

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 7\\ 2 & 5 & 8\\ 3 & 6 & 9 \end{bmatrix} $$

Then we transpose the submatrix with corners in cells $(2, 2)$ and $(3, 3)$. 

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 7\\ 2 & \textbf{5} & \textbf{8}\\ 3 & \textbf{6} & \textbf{9} \end{bmatrix} $$

So matrix becomes

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 7\\ 2 & 5 & 6\\ 3 & 8 & 9 \end{bmatrix} $$

and it is $B$.

QUESTION:
While Mahmoud and Ehab were practicing for IOI, they found a problem which name was Longest common subsequence. They solved it, and then Ehab challenged Mahmoud with another problem.

Given two strings a and b, find the length of their longest uncommon subsequence, which is the longest string that is a subsequence of one of them and not a subsequence of the other.

A subsequence of some string is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the string, The appearances don't have to be consecutive, for example, strings ""ac"", ""bc"", ""abc"" and ""a"" are subsequences of string ""abc"" while strings ""abbc"" and ""acb"" are not. The empty string is a subsequence of any string. Any string is a subsequence of itself.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than 10^5 characters.


-----Output-----

If there's no uncommon subsequence, print ""-1"". Otherwise print the length of the longest uncommon subsequence of a and b.


-----Examples-----
Input
abcd
defgh

Output
5

Input
a
a

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example: you can choose ""defgh"" from string b as it is the longest subsequence of string b that doesn't appear as a subsequence of string a.

QUESTION:
A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, ....  [Image] 

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.


-----Examples-----
Input
20 2
9 19

Output
82

Input
2 1
16 12

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. 

In the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.

QUESTION:
Vasya works as a watchman in the gallery. Unfortunately, one of the most expensive paintings was stolen while he was on duty. He doesn't want to be fired, so he has to quickly restore the painting. He remembers some facts about it.  The painting is a square 3 × 3, each cell contains a single integer from 1 to n, and different cells may contain either different or equal integers.  The sum of integers in each of four squares 2 × 2 is equal to the sum of integers in the top left square 2 × 2.  Four elements a, b, c and d are known and are located as shown on the picture below. $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline ? & {a} & {?} \\ \hline b & {?} & {c} \\ \hline ? & {d} & {?} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$

Help Vasya find out the number of distinct squares the satisfy all the conditions above. Note, that this number may be equal to 0, meaning Vasya remembers something wrong.

Two squares are considered to be different, if there exists a cell that contains two different integers in different squares.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains five integers n, a, b, c and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n) — maximum possible value of an integer in the cell and four integers that Vasya remembers.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of distinct valid squares.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1 1 1 2

Output
2

Input
3 3 1 2 3

Output
6



-----Note-----

Below are all the possible paintings for the first sample. $\left. \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline 2 & {1} & {2} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {2} & {1} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ $\left. \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline 2 & {1} & {2} \\ \hline 1 & {2} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {2} & {1} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$

In the second sample, only paintings displayed below satisfy all the rules. $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 2 & {3} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {2} \\ \hline 2 & {3} & {1} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 2 & {3} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {2} & {2} \\ \hline 2 & {3} & {1} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ $\left. \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline 2 & {3} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline 2 & {3} & {1} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 3 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {2} \\ \hline 3 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 3 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline 1 & {2} & {2} \\ \hline 3 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ $\left. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 3 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline 1 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline 3 & {3} & {2} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$

QUESTION:
Today's morning was exceptionally snowy. Meshanya decided to go outside and noticed a huge snowball rolling down the mountain! Luckily, there are two stones on that mountain.

Initially, snowball is at height $h$ and it has weight $w$. Each second the following sequence of events happens: snowball's weights increases by $i$, where $i$ — is the current height of snowball, then snowball hits the stone (if it's present at the current height), then snowball moves one meter down. If the snowball reaches height zero, it stops.

There are exactly two stones on the mountain. First stone has weight $u_1$ and is located at height $d_1$, the second one — $u_2$ and $d_2$ respectively. When the snowball hits either of two stones, it loses weight equal to the weight of that stone. If after this snowball has negative weight, then its weight becomes zero, but the snowball continues moving as before. [Image] 

Find the weight of the snowball when it stops moving, that is, it reaches height 0.


-----Input-----

First line contains two integers $w$ and $h$ — initial weight and height of the snowball ($0 \le w \le 100$; $1 \le h \le 100$).

Second line contains two integers $u_1$ and $d_1$ — weight and height of the first stone ($0 \le u_1 \le 100$; $1 \le d_1 \le h$).

Third line contains two integers $u_2$ and $d_2$ — weight and heigth of the second stone ($0 \le u_2 \le 100$; $1 \le d_2 \le h$; $d_1 \ne d_2$). Notice that stones always have different heights.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — final weight of the snowball after it reaches height 0.

In the first example, initially a snowball of weight 4 is located at a height of 3, there are two stones of weight 1, at a height of 1 and 2, respectively. The following events occur sequentially:   The weight of the snowball increases by 3 (current height), becomes equal to 7.  The snowball moves one meter down, the current height becomes equal to 2.  The weight of the snowball increases by 2 (current height), becomes equal to 9.  The snowball hits the stone, its weight decreases by 1 (the weight of the stone), becomes equal to 8.  The snowball moves one meter down, the current height becomes equal to 1.  The weight of the snowball increases by 1 (current height), becomes equal to 9.  The snowball hits the stone, its weight decreases by 1 (the weight of the stone), becomes equal to 8.  The snowball moves one meter down, the current height becomes equal to 0. 

Thus, at the end the weight of the snowball is equal to 8.

QUESTION:
At the beginning of the school year Berland State University starts two city school programming groups, for beginners and for intermediate coders. The children were tested in order to sort them into groups. According to the results, each student got some score from 1 to m points. We know that c_1 schoolchildren got 1 point, c_2 children got 2 points, ..., c_{m} children got m points. Now you need to set the passing rate k (integer from 1 to m): all schoolchildren who got less than k points go to the beginner group and those who get at strictly least k points go to the intermediate group. We know that if the size of a group is more than y, then the university won't find a room for them. We also know that if a group has less than x schoolchildren, then it is too small and there's no point in having classes with it. So, you need to split all schoolchildren into two groups so that the size of each group was from x to y, inclusive. 

Help the university pick the passing rate in a way that meets these requirements.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer m (2 ≤ m ≤ 100). The second line contains m integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{m}, separated by single spaces (0 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 100). The third line contains two space-separated integers x and y (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10000). At least one c_{i} is greater than 0.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to pick a passing rate in a way that makes the size of each resulting groups at least x and at most y, print 0. Otherwise, print an integer from 1 to m — the passing rate you'd like to suggest. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
3 4 3 2 1
6 8

Output
3

Input
5
0 3 3 4 2

Output

Input
2
2 5
3 6

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample the beginner group has 7 students, the intermediate group has 6 of them. 

In the second sample another correct answer is 3.

QUESTION:
Right now she actually isn't. But she will be, if you don't solve this problem.

You are given integers n, k, A and B. There is a number x, which is initially equal to n. You are allowed to perform two types of operations:   Subtract 1 from x. This operation costs you A coins.  Divide x by k. Can be performed only if x is divisible by k. This operation costs you B coins.  What is the minimum amount of coins you have to pay to make x equal to 1?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^9).

The third line contains a single integer A (1 ≤ A ≤ 2·10^9).

The fourth line contains a single integer B (1 ≤ B ≤ 2·10^9).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimum amount of coins you have to pay to make x equal to 1.

2

Output
12



-----Note-----

In the first testcase, the optimal strategy is as follows:   Subtract 1 from x (9 → 8) paying 3 coins.  Divide x by 2 (8 → 4) paying 1 coin.  Divide x by 2 (4 → 2) paying 1 coin.  Divide x by 2 (2 → 1) paying 1 coin. 

The total cost is 6 coins.

In the second test case the optimal strategy is to subtract 1 from x 4 times paying 8 coins in total.

QUESTION:
JATC's math teacher always gives the class some interesting math problems so that they don't get bored. Today the problem is as follows. Given an integer $n$, you can perform the following operations zero or more times:  mul $x$: multiplies $n$ by $x$ (where $x$ is an arbitrary positive integer).  sqrt: replaces $n$ with $\sqrt{n}$ (to apply this operation, $\sqrt{n}$ must be an integer). 

You can perform these operations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of $n$, that can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve that minimum value?

Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this problem, maybe you can help them?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the initial number.


-----Output-----

Print two integers: the minimum integer $n$ that can be achieved using the described operations and the minimum number of operations required.


-----Examples-----
Input
20

Output
10 2
Input
5184

Output
6 4


-----Note-----

In the first example, you can apply the operation mul $5$ to get $100$ and then sqrt to get $10$.

In the second example, you can first apply sqrt to get $72$, then mul $18$ to get $1296$ and finally two more sqrt and you get $6$.

Note, that even if the initial value of $n$ is less or equal $10^6$, it can still become greater than $10^6$ after applying one or more operations.

QUESTION:
At an arcade, Takahashi is playing a game called RPS Battle, which is played as follows:
 - The player plays N rounds of Rock Paper Scissors against the machine. (See Notes for the description of Rock Paper Scissors. A draw also counts as a round.)
 - Each time the player wins a round, depending on which hand he/she uses, he/she earns the following score (no points for a draw or a loss):
 - R points for winning with Rock;
 - S points for winning with Scissors;
 - P points for winning with Paper.
 - However, in the i-th round, the player cannot use the hand he/she used in the (i-K)-th round. (In the first K rounds, the player can use any hand.)
Before the start of the game, the machine decides the hand it will play in each round. With supernatural power, Takahashi managed to read all of those hands.
The information Takahashi obtained is given as a string T. If the i-th character of T (1 \leq i \leq N) is r, the machine will play Rock in the i-th round. Similarly, p and s stand for Paper and Scissors, respectively.
What is the maximum total score earned in the game by adequately choosing the hand to play in each round?

-----Notes-----
In this problem, Rock Paper Scissors can be thought of as a two-player game, in which each player simultaneously forms Rock, Paper, or Scissors with a hand.
 - If a player chooses Rock and the other chooses Scissors, the player choosing Rock wins;
 - if a player chooses Scissors and the other chooses Paper, the player choosing Scissors wins;
 - if a player chooses Paper and the other chooses Rock, the player choosing Paper wins;
 - if both players play the same hand, it is a draw.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq N-1
 - 1 \leq R,S,P \leq 10^4
 - N,K,R,S, and P are all integers.
 - |T| = N
 - T consists of r, p, and s.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
R S P
T

-----Output-----
Print the maximum total score earned in the game.

-----Sample Input-----
5 2
8 7 6
rsrpr

-----Sample Output-----
27

The machine will play {Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock}.
We can, for example, play {Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper} against it to earn 27 points.
We cannot earn more points, so the answer is 27.

QUESTION:
Little Vova studies programming in an elite school. Vova and his classmates are supposed to write n progress tests, for each test they will get a mark from 1 to p. Vova is very smart and he can write every test for any mark, but he doesn't want to stand out from the crowd too much. If the sum of his marks for all tests exceeds value x, then his classmates notice how smart he is and start distracting him asking to let them copy his homework. And if the median of his marks will be lower than y points (the definition of a median is given in the notes), then his mom will decide that he gets too many bad marks and forbid him to play computer games.

Vova has already wrote k tests and got marks a_1, ..., a_{k}. He doesn't want to get into the first or the second situation described above and now he needs to determine which marks he needs to get for the remaining tests. Help him do that.


-----Input-----

The first line contains 5 space-separated integers: n, k, p, x and y (1 ≤ n ≤ 999, n is odd, 0 ≤ k < n, 1 ≤ p ≤ 1000, n ≤ x ≤ n·p, 1 ≤ y ≤ p). Here n is the number of tests that Vova is planned to write, k is the number of tests he has already written, p is the maximum possible mark for a test, x is the maximum total number of points so that the classmates don't yet disturb Vova, y is the minimum median point so that mom still lets him play computer games.

The second line contains k space-separated integers: a_1, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ p) — the marks that Vova got for the tests he has already written.


-----Output-----

If Vova cannot achieve the desired result, print ""-1"".

Otherwise, print n - k space-separated integers — the marks that Vova should get for the remaining tests. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 5 18 4
3 5 4

Output
4 1

Input
5 3 5 16 4
5 5 5

Output
-1



-----Note-----

The median of sequence a_1, ..., a_{n} where n is odd (in this problem n is always odd) is the element staying on (n + 1) / 2 position in the sorted list of a_{i}.

In the first sample the sum of marks equals 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17, what doesn't exceed 18, that means that Vova won't be disturbed by his classmates. And the median point of the sequence {1, 3, 4, 4, 5} equals to 4, that isn't less than 4, so his mom lets him play computer games.

Please note that you do not have to maximize the sum of marks or the median mark. Any of the answers: ""4 2"", ""2 4"", ""5 1"", ""1 5"", ""4 1"", ""1 4"" for the first test is correct.

In the second sample Vova got three '5' marks, so even if he gets two '1' marks, the sum of marks will be 17, that is more than the required value of 16. So, the answer to this test is ""-1"".

QUESTION:
Vitya has just started learning Berlanese language. It is known that Berlanese uses the Latin alphabet. Vowel letters are ""a"", ""o"", ""u"", ""i"", and ""e"". Other letters are consonant.

In Berlanese, there has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. The only exception is a consonant ""n""; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all. For example, the words ""harakiri"", ""yupie"", ""man"", and ""nbo"" are Berlanese while the words ""horse"", ""king"", ""my"", and ""nz"" are not.

Help Vitya find out if a word $s$ is Berlanese.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of $|s|$ ($1\leq |s|\leq 100$) lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (without quotes) if there is a vowel after every consonant except ""n"", otherwise print ""NO"".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
sumimasen

Output
YES

Input
ninja

Output
YES

Input
codeforces

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first and second samples, a vowel goes after each consonant except ""n"", so the word is Berlanese.

In the third sample, the consonant ""c"" goes after the consonant ""r"", and the consonant ""s"" stands on the end, so the word is not Berlanese.

QUESTION:
Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every $a$ and $b$ such that $1 \leq a \leq b \leq 6$, there is exactly one domino with $a$ dots on one half and $b$ dots on the other half. The set contains exactly $21$ dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

 [Image] 

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 7$, $0 \leq m \leq \frac{n\cdot(n-1)}{2}$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next $m$ lines contain two integers each. Integers in the $i$-th line are $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \neq b$) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.


-----Output-----

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

Here is an illustration of Anadi's graph from the first sample test:

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

 [Image] 

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex $1$ have three dots.

QUESTION:
'Jeopardy!' is an intellectual game where players answer questions and earn points. Company Q conducts a simplified 'Jeopardy!' tournament among the best IT companies. By a lucky coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and company R2. 

The finals will have n questions, m of them are auction questions and n - m of them are regular questions. Each question has a price. The price of the i-th question is a_{i} points. During the game the players chose the questions. At that, if the question is an auction, then the player who chose it can change the price if the number of his current points is strictly larger than the price of the question. The new price of the question cannot be less than the original price and cannot be greater than the current number of points of the player who chose the question. The correct answer brings the player the points equal to the price of the question. The wrong answer to the question reduces the number of the player's points by the value of the question price.

The game will go as follows. First, the R2 company selects a question, then the questions are chosen by the one who answered the previous question correctly. If no one answered the question, then the person who chose last chooses again.

All R2 employees support their team. They want to calculate what maximum possible number of points the R2 team can get if luck is on their side during the whole game (they will always be the first to correctly answer questions). Perhaps you are not going to be surprised, but this problem was again entrusted for you to solve.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; m ≤ min(n, 30)) — the total number of questions and the number of auction questions, correspondingly. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^7) — the prices of the questions. The third line contains m distinct integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ n) — the numbers of auction questions. Assume that the questions are numbered from 1 to n.


-----Output-----

In the single line, print the answer to the problem — the maximum points the R2 company can get if it plays optimally well. It is guaranteed that the answer fits into the integer 64-bit signed type.

QUESTION:
Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is $\operatorname{max}(0.3 x,(1 - \frac{m}{250}) x - 50 w)$. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, where m_{i} (0 ≤ m_{i} ≤ 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, where w_{i} (0 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.

The last line contains two space-separated integers h_{s} and h_{u} (0 ≤ h_{s}, h_{u} ≤ 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.


-----Examples-----
Input
20 40 60 80 100
0 1 2 3 4
1 0

Output
4900

Input
119 119 119 119 119
0 0 0 0 0
10 0

Output
4930



-----Note-----

In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets $(1 - \frac{119}{250}) = \frac{131}{250}$ of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is $\frac{131}{250}(500 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500) = 3930$. Adding in 10·100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.

QUESTION:
Alice has got addicted to a game called Sirtet recently.

In Sirtet, player is given an $n \times m$ grid. Initially $a_{i,j}$ cubes are stacked up in the cell $(i,j)$. Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Player can perform the following operations:   stack up one cube in two adjacent cells;  stack up two cubes in one cell. 

Cubes mentioned above are identical in height.

Here is an illustration of the game. States on the right are obtained by performing one of the above operations on the state on the left, and grey cubes are added due to the operation. [Image] 

Player's goal is to make the height of all cells the same (i.e. so that each cell has the same number of cubes in it) using above operations. 

Alice, however, has found out that on some starting grids she may never reach the goal no matter what strategy she uses. Thus, she is wondering the number of initial grids such that   $L \le a_{i,j} \le R$ for all $1 \le i \le n$, $1 \le j \le m$;  player can reach the goal using above operations. 

Please help Alice with it. Notice that the answer might be large, please output the desired value modulo $998,244,353$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers $n$, $m$, $L$ and $R$ ($1\le n,m,L,R \le 10^9$, $L \le R$, $n \cdot m \ge 2$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer, representing the desired answer modulo $998,244,353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the only initial grid that satisfies the requirements is $a_{1,1}=a_{2,1}=a_{1,2}=a_{2,2}=1$. Thus the answer should be $1$.

In the second sample, initial grids that satisfy the requirements are $a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=1$ and $a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=2$. Thus the answer should be $2$.

QUESTION:
You are given two $n \times m$ matrices containing integers. A sequence of integers is strictly increasing if each next number is greater than the previous one. A row is strictly increasing if all numbers from left to right are strictly increasing. A column is strictly increasing if all numbers from top to bottom are strictly increasing. A matrix is increasing if all rows are strictly increasing and all columns are strictly increasing. 

For example, the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 9&10&11\\ 11&12&14\\ \end{bmatrix}$ is increasing because each individual row and column is strictly increasing. On the other hand, the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 1&1\\ 2&3\\ \end{bmatrix}$ is not increasing because the first row is not strictly increasing.

Let a position in the $i$-th row (from top) and $j$-th column (from left) in a matrix be denoted as $(i, j)$. 

In one operation, you can choose any two numbers $i$ and $j$ and swap the number located in $(i, j)$ in the first matrix with the number in $(i, j)$ in the second matrix. In other words, you can swap two numbers in different matrices if they are located in the corresponding positions.

You would like to make both matrices increasing by performing some number of operations (possibly none). Determine if it is possible to do this. If it is, print ""Possible"", otherwise, print ""Impossible"".


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n,m \leq 50$) — the dimensions of each matrix.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \ldots, a_{im}$ ($1 \leq a_{ij} \leq 10^9$) — the number located in position $(i, j)$ in the first matrix.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $b_{i1}, b_{i2}, \ldots, b_{im}$ ($1 \leq b_{ij} \leq 10^9$) — the number located in position $(i, j)$ in the second matrix.


-----Output-----

Print a string ""Impossible"" or ""Possible"".


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
2 10
11 5
9 4
3 12

Output
Possible

Input
2 3
2 4 5
4 5 6
3 6 7
8 10 11

Output
Possible

Input
3 2
1 3
2 4
5 10
3 1
3 6
4 8

Output
Impossible



-----Note-----

The first example, we can do an operation on the top left and bottom right cells of the matrices. The resulting matrices will be $\begin{bmatrix} 9&10\\ 11&12\\ \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 2&4\\ 3&5\\ \end{bmatrix}$.

In the second example, we don't need to do any operations.

In the third example, no matter what we swap, we can't fix the first row to be strictly increasing in both matrices.

QUESTION:
You are given an alphabet consisting of n letters, your task is to make a string of the maximum possible length so that the following conditions are satisfied:   the i-th letter occurs in the string no more than a_{i} times;  the number of occurrences of each letter in the string must be distinct for all the letters that occurred in the string at least once. 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2  ≤  n  ≤  26) — the number of letters in the alphabet.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — i-th of these integers gives the limitation on the number of occurrences of the i-th character in the string.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum length of the string that meets all the requirements.

QUESTION:
Makes solves problems on Decoforces and lots of other different online judges. Each problem is denoted by its difficulty — a positive integer number. Difficulties are measured the same across all the judges (the problem with difficulty d on Decoforces is as hard as the problem with difficulty d on any other judge). 

Makes has chosen n problems to solve on Decoforces with difficulties a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. He can solve these problems in arbitrary order. Though he can solve problem i with difficulty a_{i} only if he had already solved some problem with difficulty $d \geq \frac{a_{i}}{2}$ (no matter on what online judge was it).

Before starting this chosen list of problems, Makes has already solved problems with maximum difficulty k.

With given conditions it's easy to see that Makes sometimes can't solve all the chosen problems, no matter what order he chooses. So he wants to solve some problems on other judges to finish solving problems from his list. 

For every positive integer y there exist some problem with difficulty y on at least one judge besides Decoforces.

Makes can solve problems on any judge at any time, it isn't necessary to do problems from the chosen list one right after another.

Makes doesn't have too much free time, so he asked you to calculate the minimum number of problems he should solve on other judges in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n space-separated integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print minimum number of problems Makes should solve on other judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
2 1 9

Output
1

Input
4 20
10 3 6 3

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Makes at first solves problems 1 and 2. Then in order to solve the problem with difficulty 9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less than 5. The only available are difficulties 5 and 6 on some other judge. Solving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem 3.

In the second example he can solve every problem right from the start.

QUESTION:
Soon a school Olympiad in Informatics will be held in Berland, n schoolchildren will participate there.

At a meeting of the jury of the Olympiad it was decided that each of the n participants, depending on the results, will get a diploma of the first, second or third degree. Thus, each student will receive exactly one diploma.

They also decided that there must be given at least min_1 and at most max_1 diplomas of the first degree, at least min_2 and at most max_2 diplomas of the second degree, and at least min_3 and at most max_3 diplomas of the third degree.

After some discussion it was decided to choose from all the options of distributing diplomas satisfying these limitations the one that maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas of the first degree. Of all these options they select the one which maximizes the number of the participants who receive diplomas of the second degree. If there are multiple of these options, they select the option that maximizes the number of diplomas of the third degree.

Choosing the best option of distributing certificates was entrusted to Ilya, one of the best programmers of Berland. However, he found more important things to do, so it is your task now to choose the best option of distributing of diplomas, based on the described limitations.

It is guaranteed that the described limitations are such that there is a way to choose such an option of distributing diplomas that all n participants of the Olympiad will receive a diploma of some degree.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^6) — the number of schoolchildren who will participate in the Olympiad.

The next line of the input contains two integers min_1 and max_1 (1 ≤ min_1 ≤ max_1 ≤ 10^6) — the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the first degree that can be distributed.

The third line of the input contains two integers min_2 and max_2 (1 ≤ min_2 ≤ max_2 ≤ 10^6) — the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the second degree that can be distributed. 

The next line of the input contains two integers min_3 and max_3 (1 ≤ min_3 ≤ max_3 ≤ 10^6) — the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the third degree that can be distributed. 

It is guaranteed that min_1 + min_2 + min_3 ≤ n ≤ max_1 + max_2 + max_3.


-----Output-----

In the first line of the output print three numbers, showing how many diplomas of the first, second and third degree will be given to students in the optimal variant of distributing diplomas.

The optimal variant of distributing diplomas is the one that maximizes the number of students who receive diplomas of the first degree. Of all the suitable options, the best one is the one which maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas of the second degree. If there are several of these options, the best one is the one that maximizes the number of diplomas of the third degree.

QUESTION:
Every summer Vitya comes to visit his grandmother in the countryside. This summer, he got a huge wart. Every grandma knows that one should treat warts when the moon goes down. Thus, Vitya has to catch the moment when the moon is down.

Moon cycle lasts 30 days. The size of the visible part of the moon (in Vitya's units) for each day is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then cycle repeats, thus after the second 1 again goes 0.

As there is no internet in the countryside, Vitya has been watching the moon for n consecutive days and for each of these days he wrote down the size of the visible part of the moon. Help him find out whether the moon will be up or down next day, or this cannot be determined by the data he has.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 92) — the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon. 

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 15) — Vitya's records.

It's guaranteed that the input data is consistent.


-----Output-----

If Vitya can be sure that the size of visible part of the moon on day n + 1 will be less than the size of the visible part on day n, then print ""DOWN"" at the only line of the output. If he might be sure that the size of the visible part will increase, then print ""UP"". If it's impossible to determine what exactly will happen with the moon, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
3 4 5 6 7

Output
UP

Input
7
12 13 14 15 14 13 12

Output
DOWN

Input
1
8

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be equal to 8, thus the answer is ""UP"".

In the second sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be 11, thus the answer is ""DOWN"".

In the third sample, there is no way to determine whether the size of the moon on the next day will be 7 or 9, thus the answer is -1.

QUESTION:
We all know that a superhero can transform to certain other superheroes. But not all Superheroes can transform to any other superhero. A superhero with name $s$ can transform to another superhero with name $t$ if $s$ can be made equal to $t$ by changing any vowel in $s$ to any other vowel and any consonant in $s$ to any other consonant. Multiple changes can be made.

In this problem, we consider the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u' to be vowels and all the other letters to be consonants.

Given the names of two superheroes, determine if the superhero with name $s$ can be transformed to the Superhero with name $t$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string $s$ having length between $1$ and $1000$, inclusive.

The second line contains the string $t$ having length between $1$ and $1000$, inclusive.

Both strings $s$ and $t$ are guaranteed to be different and consist of lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

Output ""Yes"" (without quotes) if the superhero with name $s$ can be transformed to the superhero with name $t$ and ""No"" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
a
u

Output
Yes

Input
abc
ukm

Output
Yes

Input
akm
ua

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first sample, since both 'a' and 'u' are vowels, it is possible to convert string $s$ to $t$.

In the third sample, 'k' is a consonant, whereas 'a' is a vowel, so it is not possible to convert string $s$ to $t$.

QUESTION:
Galois is one of the strongest chess players of Byteforces. He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named «PawnChess».

This new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed.  $8$ 

Lets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (r, c) the cell located at the row r and at the column c.

There are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.

Player A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.

Moving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r - 1, c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r + 1, c). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.

Given the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.


-----Input-----

The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. 

It's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.


-----Output-----

Print 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.


-----Examples-----
Input
........
........
.B....B.
....W...
........
..W.....
........
........

Output
A

Input
..B.....
..W.....
......B.
........
.....W..
......B.
........
........

Output
B



-----Note-----

In the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4, 5). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner.

QUESTION:
Vasya has two arrays $A$ and $B$ of lengths $n$ and $m$, respectively.

He can perform the following operation arbitrary number of times (possibly zero): he takes some consecutive subsegment of the array and replaces it with a single element, equal to the sum of all elements on this subsegment. For example, from the array $[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]$ Vasya can obtain array $[1, 1110, 10000]$, and from array $[1, 2, 3]$ Vasya can obtain array $[6]$.

Two arrays $A$ and $B$ are considered equal if and only if they have the same length and for each valid $i$ $A_i = B_i$.

Vasya wants to perform some of these operations on array $A$, some on array $B$, in such a way that arrays $A$ and $B$ become equal. Moreover, the lengths of the resulting arrays should be maximal possible.

Help Vasya to determine the maximum length of the arrays that he can achieve or output that it is impossible to make arrays $A$ and $B$ equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n~(1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5)$ — the length of the first array.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n~(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — elements of the array $A$.

The third line contains a single integer $m~(1 \le m \le 3 \cdot 10^5)$ — the length of the second array.

The fourth line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_m~(1 \le b_i \le 10^9)$ - elements of the array $B$.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum length of the resulting arrays after some operations were performed on arrays $A$ and $B$ in such a way that they became equal.

If there is no way to make array equal, print ""-1"".

QUESTION:
One day Alex was creating a contest about his friends, but accidentally deleted it. Fortunately, all the problems were saved, but now he needs to find them among other problems.

But there are too many problems, to do it manually. Alex asks you to write a program, which will determine if a problem is from this contest by its name.

It is known, that problem is from this contest if and only if its name contains one of Alex's friends' name exactly once. His friends' names are ""Danil"", ""Olya"", ""Slava"", ""Ann"" and ""Nikita"".

Names are case sensitive.


-----Input-----

The only line contains string from lowercase and uppercase letters and ""_"" symbols of length, not more than 100 — the name of the problem.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"", if problem is from this contest, and ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
You've decided to carry out a survey in the theory of prime numbers. Let us remind you that a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two distinct positive integer divisors.

Consider positive integers a, a + 1, ..., b (a ≤ b). You want to find the minimum integer l (1 ≤ l ≤ b - a + 1) such that for any integer x (a ≤ x ≤ b - l + 1) among l integers x, x + 1, ..., x + l - 1 there are at least k prime numbers. 

Find and print the required minimum l. If no value l meets the described limitations, print -1.


-----Input-----

A single line contains three space-separated integers a, b, k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 10^6; a ≤ b).


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single integer — the required minimum l. If there's no solution, print -1.

QUESTION:
Arkadiy has lots square photos with size a × a. He wants to put some of them on a rectangular wall with size h × w. 

The photos which Arkadiy will put on the wall must form a rectangular grid and the distances between neighboring vertically and horizontally photos and also the distances between outside rows and columns of photos to the nearest bound of the wall must be equal to x, where x is some non-negative real number. Look on the picture below for better understanding of the statement.

 [Image] 

Arkadiy haven't chosen yet how many photos he would put on the wall, however, he want to put at least one photo. Your task is to determine the minimum value of x which can be obtained after putting photos, or report that there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy all the constraints. Suppose that Arkadiy has enough photos to make any valid arrangement according to the constraints.

Note that Arkadiy wants to put at least one photo on the wall. The photos should not overlap, should completely lie inside the wall bounds and should have sides parallel to the wall sides.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers a, h and w (1 ≤ a, h, w ≤ 10^9) — the size of photos and the height and the width of the wall.


-----Output-----

Print one non-negative real number — the minimum value of x which can be obtained after putting the photos on the wall. The absolute or the relative error of the answer must not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Print -1 if there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy the constraints.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 18 13

Output
0.5

Input
4 4 4

Output
0

Input
3 4 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example Arkadiy can put 7 rows of photos with 5 photos in each row, so the minimum value of x equals to 0.5.

In the second example Arkadiy can put only 1 photo which will take the whole wall, so the minimum value of x equals to 0.

In the third example there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy the constraints described in the statement, so the answer is -1.

QUESTION:
After lessons Nastya decided to read a book. The book contains $n$ chapters, going one after another, so that one page of the book belongs to exactly one chapter and each chapter contains at least one page.

Yesterday evening Nastya did not manage to finish reading the book, so she marked the page with number $k$ as the first page which was not read (i.e. she read all pages from the $1$-st to the $(k-1)$-th).

The next day Nastya's friend Igor came and asked her, how many chapters remain to be read by Nastya? Nastya is too busy now, so she asks you to compute the number of chapters she has not completely read yet (i.e. the number of chapters she has not started to read or has finished reading somewhere in the middle).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$) — the number of chapters in the book.

There are $n$ lines then. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $l_i$, $r_i$ separated by space ($l_1 = 1$, $l_i \leq r_i$) — numbers of the first and the last pages of the $i$-th chapter. It's guaranteed that $l_{i+1} = r_i + 1$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, and also that every chapter contains at most $100$ pages.

The $(n+2)$-th line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq r_n$) — the index of the marked page. 


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of chapters which has not been completely read so far.

-----Note-----

In the first example the book contains $11$ pages and $3$ chapters — $[1;3]$, $[4;7]$ and $[8;11]$. Nastya marked the $2$-nd page, so she finished in the middle of the $1$-st chapter. So, all chapters has not been read so far, so the answer is $3$.

The book in the second example contains $12$ pages and $3$ chapters too, but Nastya finished reading in the middle of the $2$-nd chapter, so that the answer is $2$.

QUESTION:
A large banner with word CODEFORCES was ordered for the 1000-th onsite round of Codeforces^{ω} that takes place on the Miami beach. Unfortunately, the company that made the banner mixed up two orders and delivered somebody else's banner that contains someone else's word. The word on the banner consists only of upper-case English letters.

There is very little time to correct the mistake. All that we can manage to do is to cut out some substring from the banner, i.e. several consecutive letters. After that all the resulting parts of the banner will be glued into a single piece (if the beginning or the end of the original banner was cut out, only one part remains); it is not allowed change the relative order of parts of the banner (i.e. after a substring is cut, several first and last letters are left, it is allowed only to glue the last letters to the right of the first letters). Thus, for example, for example, you can cut a substring out from string 'TEMPLATE' and get string 'TEMPLE' (if you cut out string AT), 'PLATE' (if you cut out TEM), 'T' (if you cut out EMPLATE), etc.

Help the organizers of the round determine whether it is possible to cut out of the banner some substring in such a way that the remaining parts formed word CODEFORCES.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains the word written on the banner. The word only consists of upper-case English letters. The word is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 100 characters. It is guaranteed that the word isn't word CODEFORCES.


-----Output-----

Print 'YES', if there exists a way to cut out the substring, and 'NO' otherwise (without the quotes).

QUESTION:
You are given a regular polygon with $n$ vertices labeled from $1$ to $n$ in counter-clockwise order. The triangulation of a given polygon is a set of triangles such that each vertex of each triangle is a vertex of the initial polygon, there is no pair of triangles such that their intersection has non-zero area, and the total area of all triangles is equal to the area of the given polygon. The weight of a triangulation is the sum of weigths of triangles it consists of, where the weight of a triagle is denoted as the product of labels of its vertices.

Calculate the minimum weight among all triangulations of the polygon.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 500$) — the number of vertices in the regular polygon.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum weight among all triangulations of the given polygon.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
6

Input
4

Output
18



-----Note-----

According to Wiki: polygon triangulation is the decomposition of a polygonal area (simple polygon) $P$ into a set of triangles, i. e., finding a set of triangles with pairwise non-intersecting interiors whose union is $P$.

In the first example the polygon is a triangle, so we don't need to cut it further, so the answer is $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6$.

In the second example the polygon is a rectangle, so it should be divided into two triangles. It's optimal to cut it using diagonal $1-3$ so answer is $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 6 + 12 = 18$.

QUESTION:
Alice and Bob got very bored during a long car trip so they decided to play a game. From the window they can see cars of different colors running past them. Cars are going one after another.

The game rules are like this. Firstly Alice chooses some color A, then Bob chooses some color B (A ≠ B). After each car they update the number of cars of their chosen color that have run past them. Let's define this numbers after i-th car cnt_{A}(i) and cnt_{B}(i).

  If cnt_{A}(i) > cnt_{B}(i) for every i then the winner is Alice.  If cnt_{B}(i) ≥ cnt_{A}(i) for every i then the winner is Bob.  Otherwise it's a draw. 

Bob knows all the colors of cars that they will encounter and order of their appearance. Alice have already chosen her color A and Bob now wants to choose such color B that he will win the game (draw is not a win). Help him find this color.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no such color then print -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and A (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^6) – number of cars and the color chosen by Alice.

The second line contains n integer numbers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^6) — colors of the cars that Alice and Bob will encounter in the order of their appearance.


-----Output-----

Output such color B (1 ≤ B ≤ 10^6) that if Bob chooses it then he will win the game. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no such color then print -1.

It is guaranteed that if there exists any solution then there exists solution with (1 ≤ B ≤ 10^6).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 1
2 1 4 2

Output
2

Input
5 2
2 2 4 5 3

Output
-1

Input
3 10
1 2 3

Output
4



-----Note-----

Let's consider availability of colors in the first example:   cnt_2(i) ≥ cnt_1(i) for every i, and color 2 can be the answer.  cnt_4(2) < cnt_1(2), so color 4 isn't the winning one for Bob.  All the other colors also have cnt_{j}(2) < cnt_1(2), thus they are not available. 

In the third example every color is acceptable except for 10.

QUESTION:
A one-dimensional Japanese crossword can be represented as a binary string of length x. An encoding of this crossword is an array a of size n, where n is the number of segments formed completely of 1's, and a_{i} is the length of i-th segment. No two segments touch or intersect.

For example:   If x = 6 and the crossword is 111011, then its encoding is an array {3, 2};  If x = 8 and the crossword is 01101010, then its encoding is an array {2, 1, 1};  If x = 5 and the crossword is 11111, then its encoding is an array {5};  If x = 5 and the crossword is 00000, then its encoding is an empty array. 

Mishka wants to create a new one-dimensional Japanese crossword. He has already picked the length and the encoding for this crossword. And now he needs to check if there is exactly one crossword such that its length and encoding are equal to the length and encoding he picked. Help him to check it!

QUESTION:
You have unlimited number of coins with values $1, 2, \ldots, n$. You want to select some set of coins having the total value of $S$. 

It is allowed to have multiple coins with the same value in the set. What is the minimum number of coins required to get sum $S$?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $S$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $1 \le S \le 10^9$)


-----Output-----

Print exactly one integer — the minimum number of coins required to obtain sum $S$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 11

Output
3
Input
6 16

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first example, some of the possible ways to get sum $11$ with $3$ coins are: 

  $(3, 4, 4)$

 $(2, 4, 5)$

 $(1, 5, 5)$

 $(3, 3, 5)$ 

It is impossible to get sum $11$ with less than $3$ coins.

In the second example, some of the possible ways to get sum $16$ with $3$ coins are: 

  $(5, 5, 6)$

 $(4, 6, 6)$ 

It is impossible to get sum $16$ with less than $3$ coins.

QUESTION:
A string is called palindrome if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example ""kazak"", ""oo"", ""r"" and ""mikhailrubinchikkihcniburliahkim"" are palindroms, but strings ""abb"" and ""ij"" are not.

You are given string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. At once you can choose any position in the string and change letter in that position to any other lowercase letter. So after each changing the length of the string doesn't change. At first you can change some letters in s. Then you can permute the order of letters as you want. Permutation doesn't count as changes. 

You should obtain palindrome with the minimal number of changes. If there are several ways to do that you should get the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest palindrome. So firstly you should minimize the number of changes and then minimize the palindrome lexicographically.


-----Input-----

The only line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2·10^5) consisting of only lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print the lexicographically smallest palindrome that can be obtained with the minimal number of changes.


-----Examples-----
Input
aabc

Output
abba

Input
aabcd

Output
abcba

QUESTION:
A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests.

To train their logical thinking and solve problems better, A and B decided to play chess. During the game A wondered whose position is now stronger.

For each chess piece we know its weight:   the queen's weight is 9,  the rook's weight is 5,  the bishop's weight is 3,  the knight's weight is 3,  the pawn's weight is 1,  the king's weight isn't considered in evaluating position. 

The player's weight equals to the sum of weights of all his pieces on the board.

As A doesn't like counting, he asked you to help him determine which player has the larger position weight.


-----Input-----

The input contains eight lines, eight characters each — the board's description.

The white pieces on the board are marked with uppercase letters, the black pieces are marked with lowercase letters.

The white pieces are denoted as follows: the queen is represented is 'Q', the rook — as 'R', the bishop — as'B', the knight — as 'N', the pawn — as 'P', the king — as 'K'.

The black pieces are denoted as 'q', 'r', 'b', 'n', 'p', 'k', respectively.

An empty square of the board is marked as '.' (a dot). 

It is not guaranteed that the given chess position can be achieved in a real game. Specifically, there can be an arbitrary (possibly zero) number pieces of each type, the king may be under attack and so on.


-----Output-----

Print ""White"" (without quotes) if the weight of the position of the white pieces is more than the weight of the position of the black pieces, print ""Black"" if the weight of the black pieces is more than the weight of the white pieces and print ""Draw"" if the weights of the white and black pieces are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
...QK...
........
........
........
........
........
........
...rk...

Output
White

Input
rnbqkbnr
pppppppp

PPPPPPPP
RNBQKBNR

Output
Draw

Input

...k....
........

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test sample the weight of the position of the white pieces equals to 9, the weight of the position of the black pieces equals 5.

In the second test sample the weights of the positions of the black and the white pieces are equal to 39.

In the third test sample the weight of the position of the white pieces equals to 9, the weight of the position of the black pieces equals to 16.

QUESTION:
Takahashi is playing a board game called Sugoroku.
On the board, there are N + 1 squares numbered 0 to N. Takahashi starts at Square 0, and he has to stop exactly at Square N to win the game.
The game uses a roulette with the M numbers from 1 to M. In each turn, Takahashi spins the roulette. If the number x comes up when he is at Square s, he moves to Square s+x. If this makes him go beyond Square N, he loses the game.
Additionally, some of the squares are Game Over Squares. He also loses the game if he stops at one of those squares. You are given a string S of length N + 1, representing which squares are Game Over Squares. For each i (0 \leq i \leq N), Square i is a Game Over Square if S[i] = 1 and not if S[i] = 0.
Find the sequence of numbers coming up in the roulette in which Takahashi can win the game in the fewest number of turns possible. If there are multiple such sequences, find the lexicographically smallest such sequence. If Takahashi cannot win the game, print -1.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - |S| = N + 1
 - S consists of 0 and 1.
 - S[0] = 0
 - S[N] = 0

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
S

-----Output-----
If Takahashi can win the game, print the lexicographically smallest sequence among the shortest sequences of numbers coming up in the roulette in which Takahashi can win the game, with spaces in between.
If Takahashi cannot win the game, print -1.

-----Sample Input-----
9 3
0001000100

-----Sample Output-----
1 3 2 3

If the numbers 1, 3, 2, 3 come up in this order, Takahashi can reach Square 9 via Square 1, 4, and 6. He cannot reach Square 9 in three or fewer turns, and this is the lexicographically smallest sequence in which he reaches Square 9 in four turns.

QUESTION:
Jumbo Takahashi will play golf on an infinite two-dimensional grid.
The ball is initially at the origin (0, 0), and the goal is a grid point (a point with integer coordinates) (X, Y). In one stroke, Jumbo Takahashi can perform the following operation:
 - Choose a grid point whose Manhattan distance from the current position of the ball is K, and send the ball to that point.
The game is finished when the ball reaches the goal, and the score will be the number of strokes so far. Jumbo Takahashi wants to finish the game with the lowest score possible.
Determine if the game can be finished. If the answer is yes, find one way to bring the ball to the goal with the lowest score possible.
What is Manhattan distance?
The Manhattan distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is defined as |x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - -10^5 \leq X, Y \leq 10^5
 - (X, Y) \neq (0, 0)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K
X Y

-----Output-----
If the game cannot be finished, print -1.
If the game can be finished, print one way to bring the ball to the destination with the lowest score possible, in the following format:
s
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
.
.
.
x_s y_s

Here, s is the lowest score possible, and (x_i, y_i) is the position of the ball just after the i-th stroke.

-----Sample Input-----
11
-1 2

-----Sample Output-----
3
7 4
2 10
-1 2

 - The Manhattan distance between (0, 0) and (7, 4) is |0-7|+|0-4|=11.
 - The Manhattan distance between (7, 4) and (2, 10) is |7-2|+|4-10|=11.
 - The Manhattan distance between (2, 10) and (-1, 2) is |2-(-1)|+|10-2|=11.
Thus, this play is valid.
Also, there is no way to finish the game with less than three strokes.

QUESTION:
Bad news came to Mike's village, some thieves stole a bunch of chocolates from the local factory! Horrible! 

Aside from loving sweet things, thieves from this area are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of chocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactly k times more than the previous one. The value of k (k > 1) is a secret integer known only to them. It is also known that each thief's bag can carry at most n chocolates (if they intend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there were exactly four thieves involved. 

Sadly, only the thieves know the value of n, but rumours say that the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixed n, but not fixed k) is m. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves (they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different number of chocolates in them.

Mike want to track the thieves down, so he wants to know what their bags are and value of n will help him in that. Please find the smallest possible value of n or tell him that the rumors are false and there is no such n.


-----Input-----

The single line of input contains the integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^15) — the number of ways the thieves might steal the chocolates, as rumours say.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer n — the maximum amount of chocolates that thieves' bags can carry. If there are more than one n satisfying the rumors, print the smallest one.

If there is no such n for a false-rumoured m, print  - 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
8

Input
8

Output
54

Input
10

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample case the smallest n that leads to exactly one way of stealing chocolates is n = 8, whereas the amounts of stealed chocolates are (1, 2, 4, 8) (the number of chocolates stolen by each of the thieves).

In the second sample case the smallest n that leads to exactly 8 ways is n = 54 with the possibilities: (1, 2, 4, 8),  (1, 3, 9, 27),  (2, 4, 8, 16),  (2, 6, 18, 54),  (3, 6, 12, 24),  (4, 8, 16, 32),  (5, 10, 20, 40),  (6, 12, 24, 48).

There is no n leading to exactly 10 ways of stealing chocolates in the third sample case.

QUESTION:
Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.

He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer $n$. Initially the value of $n$ equals to $v$ and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer $x$ that $x<n$ and $x$ is not a divisor of $n$, then subtract $x$ from $n$. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of $n$ in the end.

Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?


-----Input-----

The input contains only one integer in the first line: $v$ ($1 \le v \le 10^9$), the initial value of $n$.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the minimum value of $n$ the player can get.


-----Examples-----
Input
8

Output
1

Input
1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the player can choose $x=3$ in the first turn, then $n$ becomes $5$. He can then choose $x=4$ in the second turn to get $n=1$ as the result. There are other ways to get this minimum. However, for example, he cannot choose $x=2$ in the first turn because $2$ is a divisor of $8$.

In the second example, since $n=1$ initially, the player can do nothing.

QUESTION:
Bandits appeared in the city! One of them is trying to catch as many citizens as he can.

The city consists of $n$ squares connected by $n-1$ roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any square from any other square. The square number $1$ is the main square.

After Sunday walk all the roads were changed to one-way roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any square from the main square.

At the moment when the bandit appeared on the main square there were $a_i$ citizens on the $i$-th square. Now the following process will begin. First, each citizen that is currently on a square with some outgoing one-way roads chooses one of such roads and moves along it to another square. Then the bandit chooses one of the one-way roads outgoing from the square he is located and moves along it. The process is repeated until the bandit is located on a square with no outgoing roads. The bandit catches all the citizens on that square.

The bandit wants to catch as many citizens as possible; the citizens want to minimize the number of caught people. The bandit and the citizens know positions of all citizens at any time, the citizens can cooperate. If both sides act optimally, how many citizens will be caught?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ — the number of squares in the city ($2 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$).

The second line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3 \dots p_n$ meaning that there is a one-way road from the square $p_i$ to the square $i$ ($1 \le p_i < i$). 

The third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ — the number of citizens on each square initially ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of citizens the bandit will catch if both sides act optimally.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 1
3 1 2

Output
3

Input
3
1 1
3 1 3

Output
4



-----Note-----

In the first example the citizens on the square $1$ can split into two groups $2 + 1$, so that the second and on the third squares will have $3$ citizens each.

In the second example no matter how citizens act the bandit can catch at least $4$ citizens.

QUESTION:
Analyzing the mistakes people make while typing search queries is a complex and an interesting work. As there is no guaranteed way to determine what the user originally meant by typing some query, we have to use different sorts of heuristics.

Polycarp needed to write a code that could, given two words, check whether they could have been obtained from the same word as a result of typos. Polycarpus suggested that the most common typo is skipping exactly one letter as you type a word.

Implement a program that can, given two distinct words S and T of the same length n determine how many words W of length n + 1 are there with such property that you can transform W into both S, and T by deleting exactly one character. Words S and T consist of lowercase English letters. Word W also should consist of lowercase English letters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of words S and T.

The second line contains word S.

The third line contains word T.

Words S and T consist of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that S and T are distinct words.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of distinct words W that can be transformed to S and T due to a typo.

In the first sample test the two given words could be obtained only from word ""treading"" (the deleted letters are marked in bold).

In the second sample test the two given words couldn't be obtained from the same word by removing one letter.

In the third sample test the two given words could be obtained from either word ""tory"" or word ""troy"".

QUESTION:
Although Inzane successfully found his beloved bone, Zane, his owner, has yet to return. To search for Zane, he would need a lot of money, of which he sadly has none. To deal with the problem, he has decided to hack the banks. [Image] 

There are n banks, numbered from 1 to n. There are also n - 1 wires connecting the banks. All banks are initially online. Each bank also has its initial strength: bank i has initial strength a_{i}.

Let us define some keywords before we proceed. Bank i and bank j are neighboring if and only if there exists a wire directly connecting them. Bank i and bank j are semi-neighboring if and only if there exists an online bank k such that bank i and bank k are neighboring and bank k and bank j are neighboring.

When a bank is hacked, it becomes offline (and no longer online), and other banks that are neighboring or semi-neighboring to it have their strengths increased by 1.

To start his plan, Inzane will choose a bank to hack first. Indeed, the strength of such bank must not exceed the strength of his computer. After this, he will repeatedly choose some bank to hack next until all the banks are hacked, but he can continue to hack bank x if and only if all these conditions are met:  Bank x is online. That is, bank x is not hacked yet.  Bank x is neighboring to some offline bank.  The strength of bank x is less than or equal to the strength of Inzane's computer. 

Determine the minimum strength of the computer Inzane needs to hack all the banks.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the total number of banks.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the strengths of the banks.

Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n, u_{i} ≠ v_{i}) — meaning that there is a wire directly connecting banks u_{i} and v_{i}.

It is guaranteed that the wires connect the banks in such a way that Inzane can somehow hack all the banks using a computer with appropriate strength.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum strength of the computer Inzane needs to accomplish the goal.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Inzane can hack all banks using a computer with strength 5. Here is how:  Initially, strengths of the banks are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  He hacks bank 5, then strengths of the banks become [1, 2, 4, 5,  - ].  He hacks bank 4, then strengths of the banks become [1, 3, 5,  - ,  - ].  He hacks bank 3, then strengths of the banks become [2, 4,  - ,  - ,  - ].  He hacks bank 2, then strengths of the banks become [3,  - ,  - ,  - ,  - ].  He completes his goal by hacking bank 1. 

In the second sample, Inzane can hack banks 4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 7, and 6, in this order. This way, he can hack all banks using a computer with strength 93.

QUESTION:
The three friends, Kuro, Shiro, and Katie, met up again! It's time for a party...

What the cats do when they unite? Right, they have a party. Since they wanted to have as much fun as possible, they invited all their friends. Now $n$ cats are at the party, sitting in a circle and eating soup. The rules are simple: anyone having finished their soup leaves the circle.

Katie suddenly notices that whenever a cat leaves, the place where she was sitting becomes an empty space, which means the circle is divided into smaller continuous groups of cats sitting next to each other. At the moment Katie observes, there are $m$ cats who left the circle. This raises a question for Katie: what is the maximum possible number of groups the circle is divided into at the moment?

Could you help her with this curiosity?

You can see the examples and their descriptions with pictures in the ""Note"" section.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq m \leq n$) — the initial number of cats at the party and the number of cats who left the circle at the moment Katie observes, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of groups of cats at the moment Katie observes.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 4

Output
3

Input
6 2

Output
2

Input
3 0

Output
1

Input
2 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example, originally there are $7$ cats sitting as shown below, creating a single group: [Image] 

At the observed moment, $4$ cats have left the table. Suppose the cats $2$, $3$, $5$ and $7$ have left, then there are $3$ groups remaining. It is possible to show that it is the maximum possible number of groups remaining. [Image] 

In the second example, there are $6$ cats sitting as shown below: [Image] 

At the observed moment, $2$ cats have left the table. Suppose the cats numbered $3$ and $6$ left, then there will be $2$ groups remaining ($\{1, 2\}$ and $\{4, 5\}$). It is impossible to have more than $2$ groups of cats remaining. [Image] 

In the third example, no cats have left, so there is $1$ group consisting of all cats.

In the fourth example, all cats have left the circle, so there are $0$ groups.

QUESTION:
Polycarp urgently needs a shovel! He comes to the shop and chooses an appropriate one. The shovel that Policarp chooses is sold for k burles. Assume that there is an unlimited number of such shovels in the shop.

In his pocket Polycarp has an unlimited number of ""10-burle coins"" and exactly one coin of r burles (1 ≤ r ≤ 9).

What is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for the purchase without any change? It is obvious that he can pay for 10 shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of 10-burle coins and not using the coin of r burles). But perhaps he can buy fewer shovels and pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel.


-----Input-----

The single line of input contains two integers k and r (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ r ≤ 9) — the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from ""10-burle coins"". 

Remember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10, that is, Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for them without any change. 


-----Examples-----
Input
117 3

Output
9

Input
237 7

Output
1

Input
15 2

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can buy 9 shovels and pay 9·117 = 1053 burles. Indeed, he can pay this sum by using 10-burle coins and one 3-burle coin. He can't buy fewer shovels without any change.

In the second example it is enough for Polycarp to buy one shovel.

In the third example Polycarp should buy two shovels and pay 2·15 = 30 burles. It is obvious that he can pay this sum without any change.

QUESTION:
Hongcow likes solving puzzles.

One day, Hongcow finds two identical puzzle pieces, with the instructions ""make a rectangle"" next to them. The pieces can be described by an n by m grid of characters, where the character 'X' denotes a part of the puzzle and '.' denotes an empty part of the grid. It is guaranteed that the puzzle pieces are one 4-connected piece. See the input format and samples for the exact details on how a jigsaw piece will be specified.

The puzzle pieces are very heavy, so Hongcow cannot rotate or flip the puzzle pieces. However, he is allowed to move them in any directions. The puzzle pieces also cannot overlap.

You are given as input the description of one of the pieces. Determine if it is possible to make a rectangle from two identical copies of the given input. The rectangle should be solid, i.e. there should be no empty holes inside it or on its border. Keep in mind that Hongcow is not allowed to flip or rotate pieces and they cannot overlap, i.e. no two 'X' from different pieces can share the same position.


-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), the dimensions of the puzzle piece.

The next n lines will describe the jigsaw piece. Each line will have length m and will consist of characters '.' and 'X' only. 'X' corresponds to a part of the puzzle piece, '.' is an empty space.

It is guaranteed there is at least one 'X' character in the input and that the 'X' characters form a 4-connected region.


-----Output-----

Output ""YES"" if it is possible for Hongcow to make a rectangle. Output ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 3
XXX
XXX

Output
YES

Input
2 2
.X
XX

Output
NO

Input
5 5
.....
..X..
.....

Output
YES



-----Note-----

For the first sample, one example of a rectangle we can form is as follows 

111222

111222



For the second sample, it is impossible to put two of those pieces without rotating or flipping to form a rectangle.

In the third sample, we can shift the first tile by one to the right, and then compose the following rectangle: 

.....

..XX.

QUESTION:
An undirected graph is called k-regular, if the degrees of all its vertices are equal k. An edge of a connected graph is called a bridge, if after removing it the graph is being split into two connected components.

Build a connected undirected k-regular graph containing at least one bridge, or else state that such graph doesn't exist.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the required degree of the vertices of the regular graph.


-----Output-----

Print ""NO"" (without quotes), if such graph doesn't exist. 

Otherwise, print ""YES"" in the first line and the description of any suitable graph in the next lines.

The description of the made graph must start with numbers n and m — the number of vertices and edges respectively. 

Each of the next m lines must contain two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b), that mean that there is an edge connecting the vertices a and b. A graph shouldn't contain multiple edges and edges that lead from a vertex to itself. A graph must be connected, the degrees of all vertices of the graph must be equal k. At least one edge of the graph must be a bridge. You can print the edges of the graph in any order. You can print the ends of each edge in any order.

The constructed graph must contain at most 10^6 vertices and 10^6 edges (it is guaranteed that if at least one graph that meets the requirements exists, then there also exists the graph with at most 10^6 vertices and at most 10^6 edges). 


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
YES
2 1
1 2



-----Note-----

In the sample from the statement there is a suitable graph consisting of two vertices, connected by a single edge.

QUESTION:
You are given two strings $s$ and $t$, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

The substring $s[l..r]$ is the string which is obtained by taking characters $s_l, s_{l + 1}, \dots, s_r$ without changing the order.

Each of the occurrences of string $a$ in a string $b$ is a position $i$ ($1 \le i \le |b| - |a| + 1$) such that $b[i..i + |a| - 1] = a$ ($|a|$ is the length of string $a$).

You are asked $q$ queries: for the $i$-th query you are required to calculate the number of occurrences of string $t$ in a substring $s[l_i..r_i]$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers $n$, $m$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^3$, $1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the length of string $s$, the length of string $t$ and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line is a string $s$ ($|s| = n$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

The third line is a string $t$ ($|t| = m$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integer numbers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the arguments for the $i$-th query.


-----Output-----

Print $q$ lines — the $i$-th line should contain the answer to the $i$-th query, that is the number of occurrences of string $t$ in a substring $s[l_i..r_i]$.

QUESTION:
Quite recently a creative student Lesha had a lecture on trees. After the lecture Lesha was inspired and came up with the tree of his own which he called a k-tree.

A k-tree is an infinite rooted tree where:

  each vertex has exactly k children;  each edge has some weight;  if we look at the edges that goes from some vertex to its children (exactly k edges), then their weights will equal 1, 2, 3, ..., k. 

The picture below shows a part of a 3-tree.

 

 [Image]

    As soon as Dima, a good friend of Lesha, found out about the tree, he immediately wondered: ""How many paths of total weight n (the sum of all weights of the edges in the path) are there, starting from the root of a k-tree and also containing at least one edge of weight at least d?"".

Help Dima find an answer to his question. As the number of ways can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). 


-----Input-----

A single line contains three space-separated integers: n, k and d (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100; 1 ≤ d ≤ k).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

QUESTION:
Recently Adaltik discovered japanese crosswords. Japanese crossword is a picture, represented as a table sized a × b squares, and each square is colored white or black. There are integers to the left of the rows and to the top of the columns, encrypting the corresponding row or column. The number of integers represents how many groups of black squares there are in corresponding row or column, and the integers themselves represents the number of consecutive black squares in corresponding group (you can find more detailed explanation in Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword).

Adaltik decided that the general case of japanese crossword is too complicated and drew a row consisting of n squares (e.g. japanese crossword sized 1 × n), which he wants to encrypt in the same way as in japanese crossword. [Image] The example of encrypting of a single row of japanese crossword. 

Help Adaltik find the numbers encrypting the row he drew.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the row. The second line of the input contains a single string consisting of n characters 'B' or 'W', ('B' corresponds to black square, 'W' — to white square in the row that Adaltik drew).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer k — the number of integers encrypting the row, e.g. the number of groups of black squares in the row.

The second line should contain k integers, encrypting the row, e.g. corresponding to sizes of groups of consecutive black squares in the order from left to right.

QUESTION:
Recently Polycarp started to develop a text editor that works only with correct bracket sequences (abbreviated as CBS). 

Note that a bracket sequence is correct if it is possible to get a correct mathematical expression by adding ""+""-s and ""1""-s to it. For example, sequences ""(())()"", ""()"" and ""(()(()))"" are correct, while "")("", ""(()"" and ""(()))("" are not. Each bracket in CBS has a pair. For example, in ""(()(()))"":  1st bracket is paired with 8th,  2d bracket is paired with 3d,  3d bracket is paired with 2d,  4th bracket is paired with 7th,  5th bracket is paired with 6th,  6th bracket is paired with 5th,  7th bracket is paired with 4th,  8th bracket is paired with 1st. 

Polycarp's editor currently supports only three operations during the use of CBS. The cursor in the editor takes the whole position of one of the brackets (not the position between the brackets!). There are three operations being supported:  «L» — move the cursor one position to the left,  «R» — move the cursor one position to the right,  «D» — delete the bracket in which the cursor is located, delete the bracket it's paired to and all brackets between them (that is, delete a substring between the bracket in which the cursor is located and the one it's paired to). 

After the operation ""D"" the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the right (of course, among the non-deleted). If there is no such bracket (that is, the suffix of the CBS was deleted), then the cursor moves to the nearest bracket to the left (of course, among the non-deleted). 

There are pictures illustrated several usages of operation ""D"" below. [Image] 

All incorrect operations (shift cursor over the end of CBS, delete the whole CBS, etc.) are not supported by Polycarp's editor.

Polycarp is very proud of his development, can you implement the functionality of his editor?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three positive integers n, m and p (2 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 500 000, 1 ≤ p ≤ n) — the number of brackets in the correct bracket sequence, the number of operations and the initial position of cursor. Positions in the sequence are numbered from left to right, starting from one. It is guaranteed that n is even.

It is followed by the string of n characters ""("" and "")"" forming the correct bracket sequence.

Then follow a string of m characters ""L"", ""R"" and ""D"" — a sequence of the operations. Operations are carried out one by one from the first to the last. It is guaranteed that the given operations never move the cursor outside the bracket sequence, as well as the fact that after all operations a bracket sequence will be non-empty.


-----Output-----

Print the correct bracket sequence, obtained as a result of applying all operations to the initial sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
8 4 5
(())()()
RDLD

Output
()

Input
12 5 3
((()())(()))
RRDLD

Output
(()(()))

Input
8 8 8
(())()()
LLLLLLDD

Output
()()



-----Note-----

In the first sample the cursor is initially at position 5. Consider actions of the editor:  command ""R"" — the cursor moves to the position 6 on the right;  command ""D"" — the deletion of brackets from the position 5 to the position 6. After that CBS takes the form (())(), the cursor is at the position 5;  command ""L"" — the cursor moves to the position 4 on the left;  command ""D"" — the deletion of brackets from the position 1 to the position 4. After that CBS takes the form (), the cursor is at the position 1. 

Thus, the answer is equal to ().

QUESTION:
A TV show called ""Guess a number!"" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.

The rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer y and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:  Is it true that y is strictly larger than number x?  Is it true that y is strictly smaller than number x?  Is it true that y is larger than or equal to number x?  Is it true that y is smaller than or equal to number x? 

On each question the host answers truthfully, ""yes"" or ""no"".

Given the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of y that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print ""Impossible"".


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000) — the number of questions (and answers). Next n lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: ""sign x answer"", where the sign is:  "">"" (for the first type queries),  ""<"" (for the second type queries),  "">="" (for the third type queries),  ""<="" (for the fourth type queries). 

All values of x are integer and meet the inequation  - 10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The answer is an English letter ""Y"" (for ""yes"") or ""N"" (for ""no"").

Consequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.


-----Output-----

Print any of such integers y, that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number y must meet the inequation  - 2·10^9 ≤ y ≤ 2·10^9. If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word ""Impossible"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
>= 1 Y
< 3 N
<= -3 N
> 55 N

Output
17

Input
2
> 100 Y
< -100 Y

The period of the string is the smallest such positive integer $k$ that $s_i = s_{i~mod~k}$ ($0$-indexed) for each $i$. Note that this implies that $k$ won't always divide $a+b = |s|$.

For example, the period of string ""ABAABAA"" is $3$, the period of ""AAAA"" is $1$, and the period of ""AABBB"" is $5$.

Find the number of different periods over all possible strings with $a$ letters 'A' and $b$ letters 'B'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$) — the number of letters 'A' and 'B', respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the number of different periods over all possible strings with $a$ letters 'A' and $b$ letters 'B'.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 4

Output
4

Input
5 3

Output
5



-----Note-----

All the possible periods for the first example:   $3$ ""BBABBA""  $4$ ""BBAABB""  $5$ ""BBBAAB""  $6$ ""AABBBB"" 

All the possible periods for the second example:   $3$ ""BAABAABA""  $5$ ""BAABABAA""  $6$ ""BABAAABA""  $7$ ""BAABAAAB""  $8$ ""AAAAABBB"" 

Note that these are not the only possible strings for the given periods.

QUESTION:
In the army, it isn't easy to form a group of soldiers that will be effective on the battlefield. The communication is crucial and thus no two soldiers should share a name (what would happen if they got an order that Bob is a scouter, if there are two Bobs?).

A group of soldiers is effective if and only if their names are different. For example, a group (John, Bob, Limak) would be effective, while groups (Gary, Bob, Gary) and (Alice, Alice) wouldn't.

You are a spy in the enemy's camp. You noticed n soldiers standing in a row, numbered 1 through n. The general wants to choose a group of k consecutive soldiers. For every k consecutive soldiers, the general wrote down whether they would be an effective group or not.

You managed to steal the general's notes, with n - k + 1 strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} - k + 1, each either ""YES"" or ""NO"".   The string s_1 describes a group of soldiers 1 through k (""YES"" if the group is effective, and ""NO"" otherwise).  The string s_2 describes a group of soldiers 2 through k + 1.  And so on, till the string s_{n} - k + 1 that describes a group of soldiers n - k + 1 through n. 

Your task is to find possible names of n soldiers. Names should match the stolen notes. Each name should be a string that consists of between 1 and 10 English letters, inclusive. The first letter should be uppercase, and all other letters should be lowercase. Names don't have to be existing names — it's allowed to print ""Xyzzzdj"" or ""T"" for example.

Find and print any solution. It can be proved that there always exists at least one solution.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of soldiers and the size of a group respectively.

The second line contains n - k + 1 strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} - k + 1. The string s_{i} is ""YES"" if the group of soldiers i through i + k - 1 is effective, and ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Output-----

Find any solution satisfying all given conditions. In one line print n space-separated strings, denoting possible names of soldiers in the order. The first letter of each name should be uppercase, while the other letters should be lowercase. Each name should contain English letters only and has length from 1 to 10.

If there are multiple valid solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
8 3
NO NO YES YES YES NO

Output
Adam Bob Bob Cpqepqwer Limak Adam Bob Adam
Input
9 8
YES NO

Output
R Q Ccccccccc Ccocc Ccc So Strong Samples Ccc
Input
3 2
NO NO

Output
Na Na Na


-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are 8 soldiers. For every 3 consecutive ones we know whether they would be an effective group. Let's analyze the provided sample output:  First three soldiers (i.e. Adam, Bob, Bob) wouldn't be an effective group because there are two Bobs. Indeed, the string s_1 is ""NO"".  Soldiers 2 through 4 (Bob, Bob, Cpqepqwer) wouldn't be effective either, and the string s_2 is ""NO"".  Soldiers 3 through 5 (Bob, Cpqepqwer, Limak) would be effective, and the string s_3 is ""YES"".  ...,  Soldiers 6 through 8 (Adam, Bob, Adam) wouldn't be effective, and the string s_6 is ""NO"".

QUESTION:
Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of weight a and b grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: ""Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal"" ""Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?"", the curious bears asked. ""It's easy"", said the fox. ""If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal"". 

The little bears realize that the fox's proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). 


-----Output-----

If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print -1. Otherwise, print the required minimum number of operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required number is 0.

QUESTION:
A group of $n$ dancers rehearses a performance for the closing ceremony. The dancers are arranged in a row, they've studied their dancing moves and can't change positions. For some of them, a white dancing suit is already bought, for some of them — a black one, and for the rest the suit will be bought in the future.

On the day when the suits were to be bought, the director was told that the participants of the olympiad will be happy if the colors of the suits on the scene will form a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that is the same when read from left to right and when read from right to left. The director liked the idea, and she wants to buy suits so that the color of the leftmost dancer's suit is the same as the color of the rightmost dancer's suit, the 2nd left is the same as 2nd right, and so on.

The director knows how many burls it costs to buy a white suit, and how many burls to buy a black suit. You need to find out whether it is possible to buy suits to form a palindrome, and if it's possible, what's the minimal cost of doing so. Remember that dancers can not change positions, and due to bureaucratic reasons it is not allowed to buy new suits for the dancers who already have suits, even if it reduces the overall spending.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $n$, $a$, and $b$ ($1 \leq n \leq 20$, $1 \leq a, b \leq 100$) — the number of dancers, the cost of a white suit, and the cost of a black suit.

The next line contains $n$ numbers $c_i$, $i$-th of which denotes the color of the suit of the $i$-th dancer. Number $0$ denotes the white color, $1$ — the black color, and $2$ denotes that a suit for this dancer is still to be bought.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to form a palindrome without swapping dancers and buying new suits for those who have one, then output -1. Otherwise, output the minimal price to get the desired visual effect.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 100 1
0 1 2 1 2

Output
101

Input
3 10 12
1 2 0

Output
-1

Input
3 12 1
0 1 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the cheapest way to obtain palindromic colors is to buy a black suit for the third from left dancer and a white suit for the rightmost dancer.

In the second sample, the leftmost dancer's suit already differs from the rightmost dancer's suit so there is no way to obtain the desired coloring.

In the third sample, all suits are already bought and their colors form a palindrome.

QUESTION:
You are given a cube of size k × k × k, which consists of unit cubes. Two unit cubes are considered neighbouring, if they have common face.

Your task is to paint each of k^3 unit cubes one of two colours (black or white), so that the following conditions must be satisfied:  each white cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of white color;  each black cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of black color. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), which is size of the cube.


-----Output-----

Print -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print the required painting of the cube consequently by layers. Print a k × k matrix in the first k lines, showing how the first layer of the cube should be painted. In the following k lines print a k × k matrix — the way the second layer should be painted. And so on to the last k-th layer. Note that orientation of the cube in the space does not matter.

Mark a white unit cube with symbol ""w"" and a black one with ""b"". Use the format of output data, given in the test samples. You may print extra empty lines, they will be ignored.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
-1

QUESTION:
Duff is in love with lovely numbers! A positive integer x is called lovely if and only if there is no such positive integer a > 1 such that a^2 is a divisor of x. [Image] 

Malek has a number store! In his store, he has only divisors of positive integer n (and he has all of them). As a birthday present, Malek wants to give her a lovely number from his store. He wants this number to be as big as possible.

Malek always had issues in math, so he asked for your help. Please tell him what is the biggest lovely number in his store.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains one integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12).


-----Output-----

Print the answer in one line.


-----Examples-----
Input
10

Output
10

Input
12

Output
6



-----Note-----

In first sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 5 and 10 in the shop. 10 isn't divisible by any perfect square, so 10 is lovely.

In second sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 in the shop. 12 is divisible by 4 = 2^2, so 12 is not lovely, while 6 is indeed lovely.

QUESTION:
You're given a row with $n$ chairs. We call a seating of people ""maximal"" if the two following conditions hold:  There are no neighbors adjacent to anyone seated.  It's impossible to seat one more person without violating the first rule. 

The seating is given as a string consisting of zeros and ones ($0$ means that the corresponding seat is empty, $1$ — occupied). The goal is to determine whether this seating is ""maximal"".

Note that the first and last seats are not adjacent (if $n \ne 2$).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$) — the number of chairs.

The next line contains a string of $n$ characters, each of them is either zero or one, describing the seating.


-----Output-----

Output ""Yes"" (without quotation marks) if the seating is ""maximal"". Otherwise print ""No"".

You are allowed to print letters in whatever case you'd like (uppercase or lowercase).


-----Examples-----
Input
3
101

Output
Yes

Input
4
1011

Output
No

Input
5
10001

Output
No



-----Note-----

In sample case one the given seating is maximal.

In sample case two the person at chair three has a neighbour to the right.

In sample case three it is possible to seat yet another person into chair three.

QUESTION:
Bajtek, known for his unusual gifts, recently got an integer array $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1}$.

Unfortunately, after a huge array-party with his extraordinary friends, he realized that he'd lost it. After hours spent on searching for a new toy, Bajtek found on the arrays producer's website another array $a$ of length $n + 1$. As a formal description of $a$ says, $a_0 = 0$ and for all other $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) $a_i = x_{(i-1)\bmod k} + a_{i-1}$, where $p \bmod q$ denotes the remainder of division $p$ by $q$.

For example, if the $x = [1, 2, 3]$ and $n = 5$, then:  $a_0 = 0$,  $a_1 = x_{0\bmod 3}+a_0=x_0+0=1$,  $a_2 = x_{1\bmod 3}+a_1=x_1+1=3$,  $a_3 = x_{2\bmod 3}+a_2=x_2+3=6$,  $a_4 = x_{3\bmod 3}+a_3=x_0+6=7$,  $a_5 = x_{4\bmod 3}+a_4=x_1+7=9$. 

So, if the $x = [1, 2, 3]$ and $n = 5$, then $a = [0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9]$.

Now the boy hopes that he will be able to restore $x$ from $a$! Knowing that $1 \le k \le n$, help him and find all possible values of $k$ — possible lengths of the lost array.


-----Input-----

The first line contains exactly one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the length of the array $a$, excluding the element $a_0$.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$).

Note that $a_0$ is always $0$ and is not given in the input.


-----Output-----

The first line of the output should contain one integer $l$ denoting the number of correct lengths of the lost array.

The second line of the output should contain $l$ integers — possible lengths of the lost array in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
5
1 2 3 4 5 
Input
5
1 3 5 6 8

Output
2
3 5 
Input
3
1 5 3

Output
1
3 


-----Note-----

In the first example, any $k$ is suitable, since $a$ is an arithmetic progression.

Possible arrays $x$:  $[1]$ $[1, 1]$ $[1, 1, 1]$ $[1, 1, 1, 1]$  $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$

In the second example, Bajtek's array can have three or five elements.

Possible arrays $x$:  $[1, 2, 2]$ $[1, 2, 2, 1, 2]$

For example, $k = 4$ is bad, since it leads to $6 + x_0 = 8$ and $0 + x_0 = 1$, which is an obvious contradiction.

In the third example, only $k = n$ is good.

Array $[1, 4, -2]$ satisfies the requirements.

Note that $x_i$ may be negative.

QUESTION:
In a small but very proud high school it was decided to win ACM ICPC. This goal requires to compose as many teams of three as possible, but since there were only 6 students who wished to participate, the decision was to build exactly two teams.

After practice competition, participant number i got a score of a_{i}. Team score is defined as sum of scores of its participants. High school management is interested if it's possible to build two teams with equal scores. Your task is to answer that question.


-----Input-----

The single line contains six integers a_1, ..., a_6 (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — scores of the participants


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (quotes for clarity), if it is possible to build teams with equal score, and ""NO"" otherwise.

You can print each character either upper- or lowercase (""YeS"" and ""yes"" are valid when the answer is ""YES"").


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3 2 1 2 1

Output
YES

Input
1 1 1 1 1 99

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, first team can be composed of 1st, 2nd and 6th participant, second — of 3rd, 4th and 5th: team scores are 1 + 3 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

In the second sample, score of participant number 6 is too high: his team score will be definitely greater.

QUESTION:
Each evening after the dinner the SIS's students gather together to play the game of Sport Mafia. 

For the tournament, Alya puts candies into the box, which will serve as a prize for a winner. To do that, she performs $n$ actions. The first action performed is to put a single candy into the box. For each of the remaining moves she can choose from two options:

  the first option, in case the box contains at least one candy, is to take exactly one candy out and eat it. This way the number of candies in the box decreased by $1$;  the second option is to put candies in the box. In this case, Alya will put $1$ more candy, than she put in the previous time. 

Thus, if the box is empty, then it can only use the second option.

For example, one possible sequence of Alya's actions look as follows:

  put one candy into the box;  put two candies into the box;  eat one candy from the box;  eat one candy from the box;  put three candies into the box;  eat one candy from the box;  put four candies into the box;  eat one candy from the box;  put five candies into the box; 

This way she will perform $9$ actions, the number of candies at the end will be $11$, while Alya will eat $4$ candies in total.

You know the total number of actions $n$ and the number of candies at the end $k$. You need to find the total number of sweets Alya ate. That is the number of moves of the first option. It's guaranteed, that for the given $n$ and $k$ the answer always exists.

Please note, that during an action of the first option, Alya takes out and eats exactly one candy.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$; $0 \le k \le 10^9$) — the total number of moves and the number of candies in the box at the end. 

It's guaranteed, that for the given $n$ and $k$ the answer exists.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of candies, which Alya ate. Please note, that in this problem there aren't multiple possible answers — the answer is unique for any input data. 


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
0
Input
9 11

Output
4
Input
5 0

Output
3
Input
3 2

Output
1


-----Note-----

In the first example, Alya has made one move only. According to the statement, the first move is always putting one candy in the box. Hence Alya ate $0$ candies.

In the second example the possible sequence of Alya's actions looks as follows:   put $1$ candy,  put $2$ candies,  eat a candy,  eat a candy,  put $3$ candies,  eat a candy,  put $4$ candies,  eat a candy,  put $5$ candies.  

This way, she will make exactly $n=9$ actions and in the end the box will contain $1+2-1-1+3-1+4-1+5=11$ candies. The answer is $4$, since she ate $4$ candies in total.

QUESTION:
Mahmoud has n line segments, the i-th of them has length a_{i}. Ehab challenged him to use exactly 3 line segments to form a non-degenerate triangle. Mahmoud doesn't accept challenges unless he is sure he can win, so he asked you to tell him if he should accept the challenge. Given the lengths of the line segments, check if he can choose exactly 3 of them to form a non-degenerate triangle.

Mahmoud should use exactly 3 line segments, he can't concatenate two line segments or change any length. A non-degenerate triangle is a triangle with positive area.

QUESTION:
Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!

The main character of this game has n different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer a_{i} from 0 to 100. The higher the number a_{i} is, the higher is the i-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of $\lfloor \frac{a_{i}}{10} \rfloor$ for all i from 1 to n. The expression ⌊ x⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if a_4 = 46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

The second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100), where a_{i} characterizes the level of the i-th skill of the character.


-----Output-----

The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using k or less improvement units.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 4
7 9

Output
2

Input
3 8
17 15 19

Output
5

Input
2 2
99 100

Output
20



-----Note-----

In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor +  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is $\lfloor \frac{20}{10} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{19}{10} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{20}{10} \rfloor = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5$.

In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to $\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{100}{10} \rfloor = 10 + 10 = 20$.

QUESTION:
You are given two lists of non-zero digits.

Let's call an integer pretty if its (base 10) representation has at least one digit from the first list and at least one digit from the second list. What is the smallest positive pretty integer?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 9) — the lengths of the first and the second lists, respectively.

The second line contains n distinct digits a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 9) — the elements of the first list.

The third line contains m distinct digits b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 9) — the elements of the second list.


-----Output-----

Print the smallest pretty integer.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 3
4 2
5 7 6

Output
25

Input
8 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example 25, 46, 24567 are pretty, as well as many other integers. The smallest among them is 25. 42 and 24 are not pretty because they don't have digits from the second list.

In the second example all integers that have at least one digit different from 9 are pretty. It's obvious that the smallest among them is 1, because it's the smallest positive integer.

QUESTION:
Limak is going to participate in a contest on the last day of the 2016. The contest will start at 20:00 and will last four hours, exactly until midnight. There will be n problems, sorted by difficulty, i.e. problem 1 is the easiest and problem n is the hardest. Limak knows it will take him 5·i minutes to solve the i-th problem.

Limak's friends organize a New Year's Eve party and Limak wants to be there at midnight or earlier. He needs k minutes to get there from his house, where he will participate in the contest first.

How many problems can Limak solve if he wants to make it to the party?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ k ≤ 240) — the number of the problems in the contest and the number of minutes Limak needs to get to the party from his house.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the maximum possible number of problems Limak can solve so that he could get to the party at midnight or earlier.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 222

Output
2

Input
4 190

Output
4

Input
7 1

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are 3 problems and Limak needs 222 minutes to get to the party. The three problems require 5, 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Limak can spend 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to solve first two problems. Then, at 20:15 he can leave his house to get to the party at 23:57 (after 222 minutes). In this scenario Limak would solve 2 problems. He doesn't have enough time to solve 3 problems so the answer is 2.

In the second sample, Limak can solve all 4 problems in 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50 minutes. At 20:50 he will leave the house and go to the party. He will get there exactly at midnight.

In the third sample, Limak needs only 1 minute to get to the party. He has enough time to solve all 7 problems.

QUESTION:
На тренировку по подготовке к соревнованиям по программированию пришли n команд. Тренер для каждой команды подобрал тренировку, комплект задач для i-й команды занимает a_{i} страниц. В распоряжении тренера есть x листов бумаги, у которых обе стороны чистые, и y листов, у которых только одна сторона чистая. При печати условия на листе первого типа можно напечатать две страницы из условий задач, а при печати на листе второго типа — только одну. Конечно, на листе нельзя печатать условия из двух разных комплектов задач. Обратите внимание, что при использовании листов, у которых обе стороны чистые, не обязательно печатать условие на обеих сторонах, одна из них может остаться чистой.

Вам предстоит определить максимальное количество команд, которым тренер сможет напечатать комплекты задач целиком.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке входных данных следуют три целых числа n, x и y (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) — количество команд, количество листов бумаги с двумя чистыми сторонами и количество листов бумаги с одной чистой стороной.

Во второй строке входных данных следует последовательность из n целых чисел a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10 000), где i-е число равно количеству страниц в комплекте задач для i-й команды.


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите единственное целое число — максимальное количество команд, которым тренер сможет напечатать комплекты задач целиком.

Выходные данные

-----Примечание-----

В первом тестовом примере можно напечатать оба комплекта задач. Один из возможных ответов — напечатать весь первый комплект задач на листах с одной чистой стороной (после этого останется 3 листа с двумя чистыми сторонами и 1 лист с одной чистой стороной), а второй комплект напечатать на трех листах с двумя чистыми сторонами.

Во втором тестовом примере можно напечатать оба комплекта задач. Один из возможных ответов — напечатать первый комплект задач на двух листах с двумя чистыми сторонами (после этого останется 1 лист с двумя чистыми сторонами и 5 листов с одной чистой стороной), а второй комплект напечатать на одном листе с двумя чистыми сторонами и на пяти листах с одной чистой стороной. Таким образом, тренер использует все листы для печати.

В третьем тестовом примере можно напечатать только один комплект задач (любой из трёх 11-страничных). Для печати 11-страничного комплекта задач будет израсходована вся бумага.

QUESTION:
Ivan has number $b$. He is sorting through the numbers $a$ from $1$ to $10^{18}$, and for every $a$ writes $\frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a}$ on blackboard. Here $[a, \,\, b]$ stands for least common multiple of $a$ and $b$. Ivan is very lazy, that's why this task bored him soon. But he is interested in how many different numbers he would write on the board if he would finish the task. Help him to find the quantity of different numbers he would write on the board.


-----Input-----

The only line contains one integer — $b$ $(1 \le b \le 10^{10})$.


-----Output-----

Print one number — answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1
Input
2

Output
2


-----Note-----

In the first example $[a, \,\, 1] = a$, therefore $\frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a}$ is always equal to $1$.

In the second example $[a, \,\, 2]$ can be equal to $a$ or $2 \cdot a$ depending on parity of $a$. $\frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a}$ can be equal to $1$ and $2$.

QUESTION:
In a new version of the famous Pinball game, one of the most important parts of the game field is a sequence of n bumpers. The bumpers are numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right. There are two types of bumpers. They are denoted by the characters '<' and '>'. When the ball hits the bumper at position i it goes one position to the right (to the position i + 1) if the type of this bumper is '>', or one position to the left (to i - 1) if the type of the bumper at position i is '<'. If there is no such position, in other words if i - 1 < 1 or i + 1 > n, the ball falls from the game field.

Depending on the ball's starting position, the ball may eventually fall from the game field or it may stay there forever. You are given a string representing the bumpers' types. Calculate the number of positions such that the ball will eventually fall from the game field if it starts at that position.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the length of the sequence of bumpers. The second line contains the string, which consists of the characters '<' and '>'. The character at the i-th position of this string corresponds to the type of the i-th bumper.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of positions in the sequence such that the ball will eventually fall from the game field if it starts at that position.

QUESTION:
In the evening, after the contest Ilya was bored, and he really felt like maximizing. He remembered that he had a set of n sticks and an instrument. Each stick is characterized by its length l_{i}.

Ilya decided to make a rectangle from the sticks. And due to his whim, he decided to make rectangles in such a way that maximizes their total area. Each stick is used in making at most one rectangle, it is possible that some of sticks remain unused. Bending sticks is not allowed.

Sticks with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3 and a_4 can make a rectangle if the following properties are observed:  a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ a_3 ≤ a_4  a_1 = a_2  a_3 = a_4 

A rectangle can be made of sticks with lengths of, for example, 3 3 3 3 or 2 2 4 4. A rectangle cannot be made of, for example, sticks 5 5 5 7.

Ilya also has an instrument which can reduce the length of the sticks. The sticks are made of a special material, so the length of each stick can be reduced by at most one. For example, a stick with length 5 can either stay at this length or be transformed into a stick of length 4.

You have to answer the question — what maximum total area of the rectangles can Ilya get with a file if makes rectangles from the available sticks?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of the available sticks.

The second line of the input contains n positive integers l_{i} (2 ≤ l_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

The first line of the output must contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total area of the rectangles that Ilya can make from the available sticks.

QUESTION:
Petya has n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string s_{i} consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.


-----Output-----

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
ab
de
aj

Output
47

Input
5
abcdef
ghij
bdef
accbd
g

Output
136542

Input
3
aa
jj
aa

Output
44



-----Note-----

In the first example, you need to replace the letter 'a' with the digit 1, the letter 'b' with the digit 0, the letter 'd' with the digit 2, the letter 'e' with the digit 3, and the letter 'j' with the digit 4. So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11].

QUESTION:
A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests.

An important part of preparing for a competition is sharing programming knowledge from the experienced members to those who are just beginning to deal with the contests. Therefore, during the next team training A decided to make teams so that newbies are solving problems together with experienced participants.

A believes that the optimal team of three people should consist of one experienced participant and two newbies. Thus, each experienced participant can share the experience with a large number of people.

However, B believes that the optimal team should have two experienced members plus one newbie. Thus, each newbie can gain more knowledge and experience.

As a result, A and B have decided that all the teams during the training session should belong to one of the two types described above. Furthermore, they agree that the total number of teams should be as much as possible.

There are n experienced members and m newbies on the training session. Can you calculate what maximum number of teams can be formed?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 5·10^5) — the number of experienced participants and newbies that are present at the training session. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of teams that can be formed.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 6

Output
2

Input
4 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

Let's represent the experienced players as XP and newbies as NB.

In the first test the teams look as follows: (XP, NB, NB), (XP, NB, NB).

In the second test sample the teams look as follows: (XP, NB, NB), (XP, NB, NB), (XP, XP, NB).

QUESTION:
There was an epidemic in Monstropolis and all monsters became sick. To recover, all monsters lined up in queue for an appointment to the only doctor in the city.

Soon, monsters became hungry and began to eat each other. 

One monster can eat other monster if its weight is strictly greater than the weight of the monster being eaten, and they stand in the queue next to each other. Monsters eat each other instantly. There are no monsters which are being eaten at the same moment. After the monster A eats the monster B, the weight of the monster A increases by the weight of the eaten monster B. In result of such eating the length of the queue decreases by one, all monsters after the eaten one step forward so that there is no empty places in the queue again. A monster can eat several monsters one after another. Initially there were n monsters in the queue, the i-th of which had weight a_{i}.

For example, if weights are [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2] (in order of queue, monsters are numbered from 1 to 6 from left to right) then some of the options are:  the first monster can't eat the second monster because a_1 = 1 is not greater than a_2 = 2;  the second monster can't eat the third monster because a_2 = 2 is not greater than a_3 = 2;  the second monster can't eat the fifth monster because they are not neighbors;  the second monster can eat the first monster, the queue will be transformed to [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]. 

After some time, someone said a good joke and all monsters recovered. At that moment there were k (k ≤ n) monsters in the queue, the j-th of which had weight b_{j}. Both sequences (a and b) contain the weights of the monsters in the order from the first to the last.

You are required to provide one of the possible orders of eating monsters which led to the current queue, or to determine that this could not happen. Assume that the doctor didn't make any appointments while monsters were eating each other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the number of monsters in the initial queue.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the initial weights of the monsters.

The third line contains single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of monsters in the queue after the joke. 

The fourth line contains k integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k} (1 ≤ b_{j} ≤ 5·10^8) — the weights of the monsters after the joke. 

Monsters are listed in the order from the beginning of the queue to the end.


-----Output-----

In case if no actions could lead to the final queue, print ""NO"" (without quotes) in the only line. 

Otherwise print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the first line. In the next n - k lines print actions in the chronological order. In each line print x — the index number of the monster in the current queue which eats and, separated by space, the symbol 'L' if the monster which stays the x-th in the queue eats the monster in front of him, or 'R' if the monster which stays the x-th in the queue eats the monster behind him. After each eating the queue is enumerated again. 

When one monster eats another the queue decreases. If there are several answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 2 2 2 1 2
2
5 5

Output
YES
2 L
1 R
4 L
3 L

Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

15

Output
YES
5 L
4 L
3 L
2 L

Input

1 1 1 3 3
3
2 1 6

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first example, initially there were n = 6 monsters, their weights are [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2] (in order of queue from the first monster to the last monster). The final queue should be [5, 5]. The following sequence of eatings leads to the final queue:  the second monster eats the monster to the left (i.e. the first monster), queue becomes [3, 2, 2, 1, 2];  the first monster (note, it was the second on the previous step) eats the monster to the right (i.e. the second monster), queue becomes [5, 2, 1, 2];  the fourth monster eats the mosnter to the left (i.e. the third monster), queue becomes [5, 2, 3];  the finally, the third monster eats the monster to the left (i.e. the second monster), queue becomes [5, 5]. 

Note that for each step the output contains numbers of the monsters in their current order in the queue.

QUESTION:
The Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
0 0
2 0
3 1
-2 1
0 3
2 2

Output
Yes

Input
2 1
1 0
2 2
3 1

Output
No



-----Note-----

For the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.

For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.

QUESTION:
Поликарп мечтает стать программистом и фанатеет от степеней двойки. Среди двух чисел ему больше нравится то, которое делится на большую степень числа 2. 

По заданной последовательности целых положительных чисел a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} требуется найти r — максимальную степень числа 2, на которую делится хотя бы одно из чисел последовательности. Кроме того, требуется вывести количество чисел a_{i}, которые делятся на r.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке записано целое число n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — длина последовательности a.

Во второй строке записана последовательность целых чисел a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите два числа:

  r — максимальную степень двойки, на которую делится хотя бы одно из чисел заданной последовательности,  количество элементов последовательности, которые делятся на r. 


-----Примеры-----
Входные данные
5
80 7 16 4 48

Выходные данные
16 3

Входные данные
4
21 5 3 33

Выходные данные
1 4



-----Примечание-----

В первом тестовом примере максимальная степень двойки, на которую делится хотя бы одно число, равна 16 = 2^4, на неё делятся числа 80, 16 и 48.

Во втором тестовом примере все четыре числа нечётные, поэтому делятся только на 1 = 2^0. Это и будет максимальной степенью двойки для данного примера.

QUESTION:
Vasya has found a strange device. On the front panel of a device there are: a red button, a blue button and a display showing some positive integer. After clicking the red button, device multiplies the displayed number by two. After clicking the blue button, device subtracts one from the number on the display. If at some point the number stops being positive, the device breaks down. The display can show arbitrarily large numbers. Initially, the display shows number n.

Bob wants to get number m on the display. What minimum number of clicks he has to make in order to achieve this result?


-----Input-----

The first and the only line of the input contains two distinct integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), separated by a space .


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the minimum number of times one needs to push the button required to get the number m out of number n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6

Output
2

Input
10 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example you need to push the blue button once, and then push the red button once.

In the second example, doubling the number is unnecessary, so we need to push the blue button nine times.

QUESTION:
As the name of the task implies, you are asked to do some work with segments and trees.

Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph such that there is exactly one simple path between every pair of its vertices.

You are given $n$ segments $[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \dots, [l_n, r_n]$, $l_i < r_i$ for every $i$. It is guaranteed that all segments' endpoints are integers, and all endpoints are unique — there is no pair of segments such that they start in the same point, end in the same point or one starts in the same point the other one ends.

Let's generate a graph with $n$ vertices from these segments. Vertices $v$ and $u$ are connected by an edge if and only if segments $[l_v, r_v]$ and $[l_u, r_u]$ intersect and neither of it lies fully inside the other one.

For example, pairs $([1, 3], [2, 4])$ and $([5, 10], [3, 7])$ will induce the edges but pairs $([1, 2], [3, 4])$ and $([5, 7], [3, 10])$ will not.

Determine if the resulting graph is a tree or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of segments.

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contain the description of the $i$-th segment — two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i < r_i \le 2n$).

It is guaranteed that all segments borders are pairwise distinct. 


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if the resulting graph is a tree and ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input

2 11
1 3

QUESTION:
We get more and more news about DDoS-attacks of popular websites.

Arseny is an admin and he thinks that a website is under a DDoS-attack if the total number of requests for a some period of time exceeds $100 \cdot t$, where $t$ — the number of seconds in this time segment. 

Arseny knows statistics on the number of requests per second since the server is booted. He knows the sequence $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$, where $r_i$ — the number of requests in the $i$-th second after boot. 

Determine the length of the longest continuous period of time, which Arseny considers to be a DDoS-attack. A seeking time period should not go beyond the boundaries of the segment $[1, n]$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5000$) — number of seconds since server has been booted. The second line contains sequence of integers $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$ ($0 \le r_i \le 5000$), $r_i$ — number of requests in the $i$-th second.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer number — the length of the longest time period which is considered to be a DDoS-attack by Arseny. If it doesn't exist print 0.

QUESTION:
Well, the series which Stepan watched for a very long time, ended. In total, the series had n episodes. For each of them, Stepan remembers either that he definitely has watched it, or that he definitely hasn't watched it, or he is unsure, has he watched this episode or not. 

Stepan's dissatisfaction is the maximum number of consecutive series that Stepan did not watch.

Your task is to determine according to Stepan's memories if his dissatisfaction could be exactly equal to k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked. 

The second line contains the sequence which consists of n symbols ""Y"", ""N"" and ""?"". If the i-th symbol equals ""Y"", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number i. If the i-th symbol equals ""N"", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number i. If the i-th symbol equals ""?"", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number i or not.


-----Output-----

If Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to k, then print ""YES"" (without qoutes). Otherwise print ""NO"" (without qoutes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
NYNNY

Output
YES

Input
6 1
????NN

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first test Stepan remembers about all the episodes whether he has watched them or not. His dissatisfaction is 2, because he hasn't watch two episodes in a row — the episode number 3 and the episode number 4. The answer is ""YES"", because k = 2.

In the second test k = 1, Stepan's dissatisfaction is greater than or equal to 2 (because he remembers that he hasn't watch at least two episodes in a row — number 5 and number 6), even if he has watched the episodes from the first to the fourth, inclusive.

QUESTION:
We have an integer sequence A of length N, where A_1 = X, A_{i+1} = A_i + D (1 \leq  i < N ) holds.
Takahashi will take some (possibly all or none) of the elements in this sequence, and Aoki will take all of the others.
Let S and T be the sum of the numbers taken by Takahashi and Aoki, respectively. How many possible values of S - T are there?

-----Constraints-----
 - -10^8 \leq X, D \leq 10^8
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X D

-----Output-----
Print the number of possible values of S - T.

-----Sample Input-----
3 4 2

-----Sample Output-----
8

A is (4, 6, 8).
There are eight ways for (Takahashi, Aoki) to take the elements: ((), (4, 6, 8)), ((4), (6, 8)), ((6), (4, 8)), ((8), (4, 6))), ((4, 6), (8))), ((4, 8), (6))), ((6, 8), (4))), and ((4, 6, 8), ()).
The values of S - T in these ways are -18, -10, -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, and 18, respectively, so there are eight possible values of S - T.

QUESTION:
Codeforces user' handle color depends on his rating — it is red if his rating is greater or equal to 2400; it is orange if his rating is less than 2400 but greater or equal to 2200, etc. Each time participant takes part in a rated contest, his rating is changed depending on his performance.

Anton wants the color of his handle to become red. He considers his performance in the rated contest to be good if he outscored some participant, whose handle was colored red before the contest and his rating has increased after it.

Anton has written a program that analyses contest results and determines whether he performed good or not. Are you able to do the same?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of participants Anton has outscored in this contest .

The next n lines describe participants results: the i-th of them consists of a participant handle name_{i} and two integers before_{i} and after_{i} ( - 4000 ≤ before_{i}, after_{i} ≤ 4000) — participant's rating before and after the contest, respectively. Each handle is a non-empty string, consisting of no more than 10 characters, which might be lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, characters «_» and «-» characters.

It is guaranteed that all handles are distinct.


-----Output-----

Print «YES» (quotes for clarity), if Anton has performed good in the contest and «NO» (quotes for clarity) otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
Burunduk1 2526 2537
BudAlNik 2084 2214
subscriber 2833 2749

Output
YES
Input
3
Applejack 2400 2400
Fluttershy 2390 2431
Pinkie_Pie -2500 -2450

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, Anton has outscored user with handle Burunduk1, whose handle was colored red before the contest and his rating has increased after the contest.

In the second sample, Applejack's rating has not increased after the contest, while both Fluttershy's and Pinkie_Pie's handles were not colored red before the contest.

QUESTION:
In the city of Saint Petersburg, a day lasts for $2^{100}$ minutes. From the main station of Saint Petersburg, a train departs after $1$ minute, $4$ minutes, $16$ minutes, and so on; in other words, the train departs at time $4^k$ for each integer $k \geq 0$. Team BowWow has arrived at the station at the time $s$ and it is trying to count how many trains have they missed; in other words, the number of trains that have departed strictly before time $s$. For example if $s = 20$, then they missed trains which have departed at $1$, $4$ and $16$. As you are the only one who knows the time, help them!

Note that the number $s$ will be given you in a binary representation without leading zeroes.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single binary number $s$ ($0 \leq s < 2^{100}$) without leading zeroes.


-----Output-----

Output a single number — the number of trains which have departed strictly before the time $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
100000000

Output
4

Input
101

Output
2

Input
10100

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example $100000000_2 = 256_{10}$, missed trains have departed at $1$, $4$, $16$ and $64$.

In the second example $101_2 = 5_{10}$, trains have departed at $1$ and $4$.

The third example is explained in the statements.

QUESTION:
Let's assume that we are given a matrix b of size x × y, let's determine the operation of mirroring matrix b. The mirroring of matrix b is a 2x × y matrix c which has the following properties:

  the upper half of matrix c (rows with numbers from 1 to x) exactly matches b;  the lower half of matrix c (rows with numbers from x + 1 to 2x) is symmetric to the upper one; the symmetry line is the line that separates two halves (the line that goes in the middle, between rows x and x + 1). 

Sereja has an n × m matrix a. He wants to find such matrix b, that it can be transformed into matrix a, if we'll perform on it several (possibly zero) mirrorings. What minimum number of rows can such matrix contain?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains m integers — the elements of matrix a. The i-th line contains integers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im} (0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 1) — the i-th row of the matrix a.


-----Output-----

In the single line, print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of rows of matrix b.

QUESTION:
A restaurant received n orders for the rental. Each rental order reserve the restaurant for a continuous period of time, the i-th order is characterized by two time values — the start time l_{i} and the finish time r_{i} (l_{i} ≤ r_{i}).

Restaurant management can accept and reject orders. What is the maximal number of orders the restaurant can accept?

No two accepted orders can intersect, i.e. they can't share even a moment of time. If one order ends in the moment other starts, they can't be accepted both.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5) — number of orders. The following n lines contain integer values l_{i} and r_{i} each (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ 10^9).

QUESTION:
Vova has taken his summer practice this year and now he should write a report on how it went.

Vova has already drawn all the tables and wrote down all the formulas. Moreover, he has already decided that the report will consist of exactly $n$ pages and the $i$-th page will include $x_i$ tables and $y_i$ formulas. The pages are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

Vova fills the pages one after another, he can't go filling page $i + 1$ before finishing page $i$ and he can't skip pages. 

However, if he draws strictly more than $k$ tables in a row or writes strictly more than $k$ formulas in a row then he will get bored. Vova wants to rearrange tables and formulas in each page in such a way that he doesn't get bored in the process. Vova can't move some table or some formula to another page.

Note that the count doesn't reset on the start of the new page. For example, if the page ends with $3$ tables and the next page starts with $5$ tables, then it's counted as $8$ tables in a row.

Help Vova to determine if he can rearrange tables and formulas on each page in such a way that there is no more than $k$ tables in a row and no more than $k$ formulas in a row.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le k \le 10^6$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($1 \le x_i \le 10^6$) — the number of tables on the $i$-th page.

The third line contains $n$ integers $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ ($1 \le y_i \le 10^6$) — the number of formulas on the $i$-th page.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if Vova can rearrange tables and formulas on each page in such a way that there is no more than $k$ tables in a row and no more than $k$ formulas in a row.

Otherwise print ""NO"".


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2

Output
YES

Input
2 2
5 6
2 2

Output
NO

Input
4 1
4 1 10 1
3 2 10 1

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example the only option to rearrange everything is the following (let table be 'T' and formula be 'F'):   page $1$: ""TTFTTFT""  page $2$: ""TFTTFTT"" 

That way all blocks of tables have length $2$.

In the second example there is no way to fit everything in such a way that there are no more than $2$ tables in a row and $2$ formulas in a row.

QUESTION:
100 years have passed since the last victory of the man versus computer in Go. Technologies made a huge step forward and robots conquered the Earth! It's time for the final fight between human and robot that will decide the faith of the planet.

The following game was chosen for the fights: initially there is a polynomial P(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n} - 1x^{n} - 1 + ... + a_1x + a_0,  with yet undefined coefficients and the integer k. Players alternate their turns. At each turn, a player pick some index j, such that coefficient a_{j} that stay near x^{j} is not determined yet and sets it to any value (integer or real, positive or negative, 0 is also allowed). Computer moves first. The human will be declared the winner if and only if the resulting polynomial will be divisible by Q(x) = x - k.

Polynomial P(x) is said to be divisible by polynomial Q(x) if there exists a representation P(x) = B(x)Q(x), where B(x) is also some polynomial.

Some moves have been made already and now you wonder, is it true that human can guarantee the victory if he plays optimally?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, |k| ≤ 10 000) — the size of the polynomial and the integer k.

The i-th of the following n + 1 lines contain character '?' if the coefficient near x^{i} - 1 is yet undefined or the integer value a_{i}, if the coefficient is already known ( - 10 000 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10 000). Each of integers a_{i} (and even a_{n}) may be equal to 0.

Please note, that it's not guaranteed that you are given the position of the game where it's computer's turn to move.


-----Output-----

Print ""Yes"" (without quotes) if the human has winning strategy, or ""No"" (without quotes) otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
-1
?

Output
Yes

Input
2 100
-10000
0
1

Output
Yes
Input
4 5
?
1
?
1
?

Output
No


-----Note-----

In the first sample, computer set a_0 to  - 1 on the first move, so if human can set coefficient a_1 to 0.5 and win.

In the second sample, all coefficients are already set and the resulting polynomial is divisible by x - 100, so the human has won.

QUESTION:
Alice and Bob begin their day with a quick game. They first choose a starting number X_0 ≥ 3 and try to reach one million by the process described below. 

Alice goes first and then they take alternating turns. In the i-th turn, the player whose turn it is selects a prime number smaller than the current number, and announces the smallest multiple of this prime number that is not smaller than the current number.

Formally, he or she selects a prime p < X_{i} - 1 and then finds the minimum X_{i} ≥ X_{i} - 1 such that p divides X_{i}. Note that if the selected prime p already divides X_{i} - 1, then the number does not change.

Eve has witnessed the state of the game after two turns. Given X_2, help her determine what is the smallest possible starting number X_0. Note that the players don't necessarily play optimally. You should consider all possible game evolutions.


-----Input-----

The input contains a single integer X_2 (4 ≤ X_2 ≤ 10^6). It is guaranteed that the integer X_2 is composite, that is, is not prime.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimum possible X_0.


-----Examples-----
Input
14

Output
6

Input
20

Output
15

Input
8192

Output
8191



-----Note-----

In the first test, the smallest possible starting number is X_0 = 6. One possible course of the game is as follows:   Alice picks prime 5 and announces X_1 = 10  Bob picks prime 7 and announces X_2 = 14. 

In the second case, let X_0 = 15.   Alice picks prime 2 and announces X_1 = 16  Bob picks prime 5 and announces X_2 = 20.

QUESTION:
Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer $p$ (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented $p$-binary numbers of the form $2^x + p$, where $x$ is a non-negative integer.

For example, some $-9$-binary (""minus nine"" binary) numbers are: $-8$ (minus eight), $7$ and $1015$ ($-8=2^0-9$, $7=2^4-9$, $1015=2^{10}-9$).

The boys now use $p$-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer $n$, what's the smallest number of $p$-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent $n$ as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if $p=0$ we can represent $7$ as $2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2$.

And if $p=-9$ we can represent $7$ as one number $(2^4-9)$.

Note that negative $p$-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$, $-1000 \leq p \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to represent $n$ as the sum of any number of $p$-binary numbers, print a single integer $-1$. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.


-----Examples-----
Input
24 0

Output
2

Input
24 1

Output
3

Input
24 -1

Output
4

Input
4 -7

Output
2

Input
1 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

$0$-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent $24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0)$.

In the second sample case, we can represent $24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1)$.

In the third sample case, we can represent $24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1)$. Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent $4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7)$. Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

QUESTION:
Ania has a large integer $S$. Its decimal representation has length $n$ and doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Ania is allowed to change at most $k$ digits of $S$. She wants to do it in such a way that $S$ still won't contain any leading zeroes and it'll be minimal possible. What integer will Ania finish with?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$, $0 \leq k \leq n$) — the number of digits in the decimal representation of $S$ and the maximum allowed number of changed digits.

The second line contains the integer $S$. It's guaranteed that $S$ has exactly $n$ digits and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.


-----Output-----

Output the minimal possible value of $S$ which Ania can end with. Note that the resulting integer should also have $n$ digits.

A number has leading zeroes if it consists of at least two digits and its first digit is $0$. For example, numbers $00$, $00069$ and $0101$ have leading zeroes, while $0$, $3000$ and $1010$ don't have leading zeroes.

QUESTION:
You have two friends. You want to present each of them several positive integers. You want to present cnt_1 numbers to the first friend and cnt_2 numbers to the second friend. Moreover, you want all presented numbers to be distinct, that also means that no number should be presented to both friends.

In addition, the first friend does not like the numbers that are divisible without remainder by prime number x. The second one does not like the numbers that are divisible without remainder by prime number y. Of course, you're not going to present your friends numbers they don't like.

Your task is to find such minimum number v, that you can form presents using numbers from a set 1, 2, ..., v. Of course you may choose not to present some numbers at all.

A positive integer number greater than 1 is called prime if it has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four positive integers cnt_1, cnt_2, x, y (1 ≤ cnt_1, cnt_2 < 10^9; cnt_1 + cnt_2 ≤ 10^9; 2 ≤ x < y ≤ 3·10^4) — the numbers that are described in the statement. It is guaranteed that numbers x, y are prime.

-----Note-----

In the first sample you give the set of numbers {1, 3, 5} to the first friend and the set of numbers {2} to the second friend. Note that if you give set {1, 3, 5} to the first friend, then we cannot give any of the numbers 1, 3, 5 to the second friend. 

In the second sample you give the set of numbers {3} to the first friend, and the set of numbers {1, 2, 4} to the second friend. Thus, the answer to the problem is 4.

QUESTION:
Our bear's forest has a checkered field. The checkered field is an n × n table, the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Let's denote a cell of the field on the intersection of row x and column y by record (x, y). Each cell of the field contains growing raspberry, at that, the cell (x, y) of the field contains x + y raspberry bushes.

The bear came out to walk across the field. At the beginning of the walk his speed is (dx, dy). Then the bear spends exactly t seconds on the field. Each second the following takes place:  Let's suppose that at the current moment the bear is in cell (x, y).  First the bear eats the raspberry from all the bushes he has in the current cell. After the bear eats the raspberry from k bushes, he increases each component of his speed by k. In other words, if before eating the k bushes of raspberry his speed was (dx, dy), then after eating the berry his speed equals (dx + k, dy + k).  Let's denote the current speed of the bear (dx, dy) (it was increased after the previous step). Then the bear moves from cell (x, y) to cell (((x + dx - 1) mod n) + 1, ((y + dy - 1) mod n) + 1).  Then one additional raspberry bush grows in each cell of the field. 

You task is to predict the bear's actions. Find the cell he ends up in if he starts from cell (sx, sy). Assume that each bush has infinitely much raspberry and the bear will never eat all of it.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains six space-separated integers: n, sx, sy, dx, dy, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ sx, sy ≤ n;  - 100 ≤ dx, dy ≤ 100; 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print two integers — the coordinates of the cell the bear will end up in after t seconds.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 1 2 0 1 2

Output
3 1
Input
1 1 1 -1 -1 2

Output
1 1


-----Note-----

Operation a mod b means taking the remainder after dividing a by b. Note that the result of the operation is always non-negative. For example, ( - 1) mod 3 = 2.

In the first sample before the first move the speed vector will equal (3,4) and the bear will get to cell (4,1). Before the second move the speed vector will equal (9,10) and he bear will get to cell (3,1). Don't forget that at the second move, the number of berry bushes increased by 1.

In the second sample before the first move the speed vector will equal (1,1) and the bear will get to cell (1,1). Before the second move, the speed vector will equal (4,4) and the bear will get to cell (1,1). Don't forget that at the second move, the number of berry bushes increased by 1.

QUESTION:
ZS the Coder loves to read the dictionary. He thinks that a word is nice if there exists a substring (contiguous segment of letters) of it of length 26 where each letter of English alphabet appears exactly once. In particular, if the string has length strictly less than 26, no such substring exists and thus it is not nice.

Now, ZS the Coder tells you a word, where some of its letters are missing as he forgot them. He wants to determine if it is possible to fill in the missing letters so that the resulting word is nice. If it is possible, he needs you to find an example of such a word as well. Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 50 000), the word that ZS the Coder remembers. Each character of the string is the uppercase letter of English alphabet ('A'-'Z') or is a question mark ('?'), where the question marks denotes the letters that ZS the Coder can't remember.


-----Output-----

If there is no way to replace all the question marks with uppercase letters such that the resulting word is nice, then print  - 1 in the only line.

Otherwise, print a string which denotes a possible nice word that ZS the Coder learned. This string should match the string from the input, except for the question marks replaced with uppercase English letters.

If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
ABC??FGHIJK???OPQR?TUVWXY?

Output
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRZTUVWXYS
Input
WELCOMETOCODEFORCESROUNDTHREEHUNDREDANDSEVENTYTWO

Output
-1
Input
??????????????????????????

Output
MNBVCXZLKJHGFDSAQPWOEIRUYT
Input
AABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW??M

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first sample case, ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRZTUVWXYS is a valid answer beacuse it contains a substring of length 26 (the whole string in this case) which contains all the letters of the English alphabet exactly once. Note that there are many possible solutions, such as ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ or ABCEDFGHIJKLMNOPQRZTUVWXYS.

In the second sample case, there are no missing letters. In addition, the given string does not have a substring of length 26 that contains all the letters of the alphabet, so the answer is  - 1.

In the third sample case, any string of length 26 that contains all letters of the English alphabet fits as an answer.

QUESTION:
Kitahara Haruki has bought n apples for Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna. Now he wants to divide all the apples between the friends.

Each apple weights 100 grams or 200 grams. Of course Kitahara Haruki doesn't want to offend any of his friend. Therefore the total weight of the apples given to Touma Kazusa must be equal to the total weight of the apples given to Ogiso Setsuna.

But unfortunately Kitahara Haruki doesn't have a knife right now, so he cannot split any apple into some parts. Please, tell him: is it possible to divide all the apples in a fair way between his friends?


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of apples. The second line contains n integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n} (w_{i} = 100 or w_{i} = 200), where w_{i} is the weight of the i-th apple.


-----Output-----

In a single line print ""YES"" (without the quotes) if it is possible to divide all the apples between his friends. Otherwise print ""NO"" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3
100 200 100

Output
YES

Input
4
100 100 100 200

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first test sample Kitahara Haruki can give the first and the last apple to Ogiso Setsuna and the middle apple to Touma Kazusa.

QUESTION:
Some people leave the lights at their workplaces on when they leave that is a waste of resources. As a hausmeister of DHBW, Sagheer waits till all students and professors leave the university building, then goes and turns all the lights off.

The building consists of n floors with stairs at the left and the right sides. Each floor has m rooms on the same line with a corridor that connects the left and right stairs passing by all the rooms. In other words, the building can be represented as a rectangle with n rows and m + 2 columns, where the first and the last columns represent the stairs, and the m columns in the middle represent rooms.

Sagheer is standing at the ground floor at the left stairs. He wants to turn all the lights off in such a way that he will not go upstairs until all lights in the floor he is standing at are off. Of course, Sagheer must visit a room to turn the light there off. It takes one minute for Sagheer to go to the next floor using stairs or to move from the current room/stairs to a neighboring room/stairs on the same floor. It takes no time for him to switch the light off in the room he is currently standing in. Help Sagheer find the minimum total time to turn off all the lights.

Note that Sagheer does not have to go back to his starting position, and he does not have to visit rooms where the light is already switched off.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 15 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of floors and the number of rooms in each floor, respectively.

The next n lines contains the building description. Each line contains a binary string of length m + 2 representing a floor (the left stairs, then m rooms, then the right stairs) where 0 indicates that the light is off and 1 indicates that the light is on. The floors are listed from top to bottom, so that the last line represents the ground floor.

The first and last characters of each string represent the left and the right stairs, respectively, so they are always 0.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum total time needed to turn off all the lights.

-----Note-----

In the first example, Sagheer will go to room 1 in the ground floor, then he will go to room 2 in the second floor using the left or right stairs.

In the second example, he will go to the fourth room in the ground floor, use right stairs, go to the fourth room in the second floor, use right stairs again, then go to the second room in the last floor.

In the third example, he will walk through the whole corridor alternating between the left and right stairs at each floor.

QUESTION:
Medicine faculty of Berland State University has just finished their admission campaign. As usual, about $80\%$ of applicants are girls and majority of them are going to live in the university dormitory for the next $4$ (hopefully) years.

The dormitory consists of $n$ rooms and a single mouse! Girls decided to set mouse traps in some rooms to get rid of the horrible monster. Setting a trap in room number $i$ costs $c_i$ burles. Rooms are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

Mouse doesn't sit in place all the time, it constantly runs. If it is in room $i$ in second $t$ then it will run to room $a_i$ in second $t + 1$ without visiting any other rooms inbetween ($i = a_i$ means that mouse won't leave room $i$). It's second $0$ in the start. If the mouse is in some room with a mouse trap in it, then the mouse get caught into this trap.

That would have been so easy if the girls actually knew where the mouse at. Unfortunately, that's not the case, mouse can be in any room from $1$ to $n$ at second $0$.

What it the minimal total amount of burles girls can spend to set the traps in order to guarantee that the mouse will eventually be caught no matter the room it started from?


-----Input-----

The first line contains as single integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of rooms in the dormitory.

The second line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ ($1 \le c_i \le 10^4$) — $c_i$ is the cost of setting the trap in room number $i$.

The third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) — $a_i$ is the room the mouse will run to the next second after being in room $i$.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimal total amount of burles girls can spend to set the traps in order to guarantee that the mouse will eventually be caught no matter the room it started from.


-----Examples-----

2 4 2 2

Output
10

Input
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 3 6 7 6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example it is enough to set mouse trap in rooms $1$ and $4$. If mouse starts in room $1$ then it gets caught immideately. If mouse starts in any other room then it eventually comes to room $4$.

In the second example it is enough to set mouse trap in room $2$. If mouse starts in room $2$ then it gets caught immideately. If mouse starts in any other room then it runs to room $2$ in second $1$.

Here are the paths of the mouse from different starts from the third example:

  $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \dots$;  $2 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \dots$;  $3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \dots$;  $4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \dots$;  $5 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow \dots$;  $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow \dots$;  $7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow \dots$; 

So it's enough to set traps in rooms $2$ and $6$.

QUESTION:
Vasya lives in a round building, whose entrances are numbered sequentially by integers from 1 to n. Entrance n and entrance 1 are adjacent.

Today Vasya got bored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance a and he decided that during his walk he will move around the house b entrances in the direction of increasing numbers (in this order entrance n should be followed by entrance 1). The negative value of b corresponds to moving |b| entrances in the order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance 1 is followed by entrance n). If b = 0, then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance. [Image] Illustration for n = 6, a = 2, b =  - 5. 

Help Vasya to determine the number of the entrance, near which he will be at the end of his walk.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, a and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ n,  - 100 ≤ b ≤ 100) — the number of entrances at Vasya's place, the number of his entrance and the length of his walk, respectively.

QUESTION:
Polycarpus develops an interesting theory about the interrelation of arithmetic progressions with just everything in the world. His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions.

Polycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8, 6, 4, 2), (1, 4, 7, 10) and (2), which are written one after another.

Unfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of a_{i} ​​may be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1.

For a given sequence a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}), which consists of positive integers and values ​​-1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values ​​-1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values a_{i} > 0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.

Let us remind you that a finite sequence c is called an arithmetic progression if the difference c_{i} + 1 - c_{i} of any two consecutive elements in it is constant. By definition, any sequence of length 1 is an arithmetic progression.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains integer values a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} separated by a space (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9 or a_{i} =  - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of arithmetic progressions that you need to write one after another to get sequence a. The positions marked as -1 in a can be represented by any positive integers.

QUESTION:
High school student Vasya got a string of length n as a birthday present. This string consists of letters 'a' and 'b' only. Vasya denotes beauty of the string as the maximum length of a substring (consecutive subsequence) consisting of equal letters.

Vasya can change no more than k characters of the original string. What is the maximum beauty of the string he can achieve?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the length of the string and the maximum number of characters to change.

The second line contains the string, consisting of letters 'a' and 'b' only.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the maximum beauty of the string Vasya can achieve by changing no more than k characters.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
abba

Output
4

Input
8 1
aabaabaa

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasya can obtain both strings ""aaaa"" and ""bbbb"".

In the second sample, the optimal answer is obtained with the string ""aaaaabaa"" or with the string ""aabaaaaa"".

QUESTION:
Alice is the leader of the State Refactoring Party, and she is about to become the prime minister. 

The elections have just taken place. There are $n$ parties, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th party has received $a_i$ seats in the parliament.

Alice's party has number $1$. In order to become the prime minister, she needs to build a coalition, consisting of her party and possibly some other parties. There are two conditions she needs to fulfil:   The total number of seats of all parties in the coalition must be a strict majority of all the seats, i.e. it must have strictly more than half of the seats. For example, if the parliament has $200$ (or $201$) seats, then the majority is $101$ or more seats.  Alice's party must have at least $2$ times more seats than any other party in the coalition. For example, to invite a party with $50$ seats, Alice's party must have at least $100$ seats. 

For example, if $n=4$ and $a=[51, 25, 99, 25]$ (note that Alice'a party has $51$ seats), then the following set $[a_1=51, a_2=25, a_4=25]$ can create a coalition since both conditions will be satisfied. However, the following sets will not create a coalition:

  $[a_2=25, a_3=99, a_4=25]$ since Alice's party is not there;  $[a_1=51, a_2=25]$ since coalition should have a strict majority;  $[a_1=51, a_2=25, a_3=99]$ since Alice's party should have at least $2$ times more seats than any other party in the coalition. 

Alice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition. If she wants, she can invite as many parties as she wants (as long as the conditions are satisfied). If Alice's party has enough people to create a coalition on her own, she can invite no parties.

Note that Alice can either invite a party as a whole or not at all. It is not possible to invite only some of the deputies (seats) from another party. In other words, if Alice invites a party, she invites all its deputies.

Find and print any suitable coalition.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$) — the number of parties.

The second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 100$) — the number of seats the $i$-th party has.


-----Output-----

If no coalition satisfying both conditions is possible, output a single line with an integer $0$.

Otherwise, suppose there are $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n$) parties in the coalition (Alice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition), and their indices are $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq n$). Output two lines, first containing the integer $k$, and the second the space-separated indices $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k$. 

You may print the parties in any order. Alice's party (number $1$) must be on that list. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
100 50 50

Output
2
1 2

Input
3
80 60 60

Output
0

Input

6 5

Output

Input
4
51 25 99 25

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, Alice picks the second party. Note that she can also pick the third party or both of them. However, she cannot become prime minister without any of them, because $100$ is not a strict majority out of $200$.

In the second example, there is no way of building a majority, as both other parties are too large to become a coalition partner.

In the third example, Alice already has the majority. 

The fourth example is described in the problem statement.

QUESTION:
3R2 - Standby for Action

Our dear Cafe's owner, JOE Miller, will soon take part in a new game TV-show ""1 vs. $n$""!

The game goes in rounds, where in each round the host asks JOE and his opponents a common question. All participants failing to answer are eliminated. The show ends when only JOE remains (we assume that JOE never answers a question wrong!).

For each question JOE answers, if there are $s$ ($s > 0$) opponents remaining and $t$ ($0 \le t \le s$) of them make a mistake on it, JOE receives $\displaystyle\frac{t}{s}$ dollars, and consequently there will be $s - t$ opponents left for the next question.

JOE wonders what is the maximum possible reward he can receive in the best possible scenario. Yet he has little time before show starts, so can you help him answering it instead?


-----Input-----

The first and single line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), denoting the number of JOE's opponents in the show.


-----Output-----

Print a number denoting the maximum prize (in dollars) JOE could have.

Your answer will be considered correct if it's absolute or relative error won't exceed $10^{-4}$. In other words, if your answer is $a$ and the jury answer is $b$, then it must hold that $\frac{|a - b|}{max(1, b)} \le 10^{-4}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1.000000000000

Input
2

Output
1.500000000000



-----Note-----

In the second example, the best scenario would be: one contestant fails at the first question, the other fails at the next one. The total reward will be $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{1} = 1.5$ dollars.

QUESTION:
The following problem is well-known: given integers n and m, calculate $2^{n} \operatorname{mod} m$, 

where 2^{n} = 2·2·...·2 (n factors), and $x \operatorname{mod} y$ denotes the remainder of division of x by y.

You are asked to solve the ""reverse"" problem. Given integers n and m, calculate $m \operatorname{mod} 2^{n}$. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^8).

The second line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^8).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the value of $m \operatorname{mod} 2^{n}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
42

Output
10

Input
1
58

Output
0

Input
98765432
23456789

Output
23456789



-----Note-----

In the first example, the remainder of division of 42 by 2^4 = 16 is equal to 10.

In the second example, 58 is divisible by 2^1 = 2 without remainder, and the answer is 0.

QUESTION:
Victor tries to write his own text editor, with word correction included. However, the rules of word correction are really strange.

Victor thinks that if a word contains two consecutive vowels, then it's kinda weird and it needs to be replaced. So the word corrector works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it. If there are no two consecutive vowels in the word, it is considered to be correct.

You are given a word s. Can you predict what will it become after correction?

In this problem letters a, e, i, o, u and y are considered to be vowels.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of letters in word s before the correction.

The second line contains a string s consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters — the word before the correction.


-----Output-----

Output the word s after the correction.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
weird

Output
werd

Input
4
word

Output
word

Input
5
aaeaa

Output
a



-----Note-----

Explanations of the examples:  There is only one replace: weird $\rightarrow$ werd; No replace needed since there are no two consecutive vowels; aaeaa $\rightarrow$ aeaa $\rightarrow$ aaa $\rightarrow$ aa $\rightarrow$ a.

QUESTION:
There are $n$ consecutive seat places in a railway carriage. Each place is either empty or occupied by a passenger.

The university team for the Olympiad consists of $a$ student-programmers and $b$ student-athletes. Determine the largest number of students from all $a+b$ students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that:  no student-programmer is sitting next to the student-programmer;  and no student-athlete is sitting next to the student-athlete. 

In the other words, there should not be two consecutive (adjacent) places where two student-athletes or two student-programmers are sitting.

Consider that initially occupied seat places are occupied by jury members (who obviously are not students at all).


-----Input-----

The first line contain three integers $n$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^{5}$, $0 \le a, b \le 2\cdot10^{5}$, $a + b > 0$) — total number of seat places in the railway carriage, the number of student-programmers and the number of student-athletes.

The second line contains a string with length $n$, consisting of characters ""."" and ""*"". The dot means that the corresponding place is empty. The asterisk means that the corresponding place is occupied by the jury member.


-----Output-----

Print the largest number of students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that no student-programmer is sitting next to a student-programmer and no student-athlete is sitting next to a student-athlete.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 1 1
*...*

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example you can put all student, for example, in the following way: *.AB*

In the second example you can put four students, for example, in the following way: *BAB*B

In the third example you can put seven students, for example, in the following way: B*ABAB**A*B

The letter A means a student-programmer, and the letter B — student-athlete.

QUESTION:
Melody Pond was stolen from her parents as a newborn baby by Madame Kovarian, to become a weapon of the Silence in their crusade against the Doctor. Madame Kovarian changed Melody's name to River Song, giving her a new identity that allowed her to kill the Eleventh Doctor.

Heidi figured out that Madame Kovarian uses a very complicated hashing function in order to change the names of the babies she steals. In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques.

The first hashing function she designed is as follows.

Given two positive integers $(x, y)$ she defines $H(x,y):=x^2+2xy+x+1$.

Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible. That is, given a positive integer $r$, can you find a pair $(x, y)$ (of positive integers) such that $H(x, y) = r$?

If multiple such pairs exist, output the one with smallest possible $x$. If there is no such pair, output ""NO"".


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains an integer $r$ ($1 \le r \le 10^{12}$).


-----Output-----

Output integers $x, y$ such that $H(x,y) = r$ and $x$ is smallest possible, or ""NO"" if no such pair exists.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
There are quite a lot of ways to have fun with inflatable balloons. For example, you can fill them with water and see what happens.

Grigory and Andrew have the same opinion. So, once upon a time, they went to the shop and bought $n$ packets with inflatable balloons, where $i$-th of them has exactly $a_i$ balloons inside.

They want to divide the balloons among themselves. In addition, there are several conditions to hold:

  Do not rip the packets (both Grigory and Andrew should get unbroken packets);  Distribute all packets (every packet should be given to someone);  Give both Grigory and Andrew at least one packet;  To provide more fun, the total number of balloons in Grigory's packets should not be equal to the total number of balloons in Andrew's packets. 

Help them to divide the balloons or determine that it's impossible under these conditions.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10$) — the number of packets with balloons.

The second line contains $n$ integers: $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$) — the number of balloons inside the corresponding packet.


-----Output-----

If it's impossible to divide the balloons satisfying the conditions above, print $-1$.

Otherwise, print an integer $k$ — the number of packets to give to Grigory followed by $k$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ — the indices of those. The order of packets doesn't matter.

If there are multiple ways to divide balloons, output any of them.


-----Examples-----

3
1 2 1

Output
2
1 2

Input
2
5 5

Output
-1

Input
1
10

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test Grigory gets $3$ balloons in total while Andrey gets $1$.

In the second test there's only one way to divide the packets which leads to equal numbers of balloons.

In the third test one of the boys won't get a packet at all.

QUESTION:
Vasya has his favourite number $n$. He wants to split it to some non-zero digits. It means, that he wants to choose some digits $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$, such that $1 \leq d_i \leq 9$ for all $i$ and $d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_k = n$.

Vasya likes beauty in everything, so he wants to find any solution with the minimal possible number of different digits among $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$. Help him!


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ — the number that Vasya wants to split ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print one integer $k$ — the number of digits in the partition. Note that $k$ must satisfy the inequality $1 \leq k \leq n$. In the next line print $k$ digits $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ separated by spaces. All digits must satisfy the inequalities $1 \leq d_i \leq 9$.

You should find a partition of $n$ in which the number of different digits among $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ will be minimal possible among all partitions of $n$ into non-zero digits. Among such partitions, it is allowed to find any. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one partition of the number $n$ into digits.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1
1 
Input
4

Output
2
2 2

Input
27

Output
3
9 9 9



-----Note-----

In the first test, the number $1$ can be divided into $1$ digit equal to $1$.

In the second test, there are $3$ partitions of the number $4$ into digits in which the number of different digits is $1$. This partitions are $[1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[2, 2]$ and $[4]$. Any of these partitions can be found. And, for example, dividing the number $4$ to the digits $[1, 1, 2]$ isn't an answer, because it has $2$ different digits, that isn't the minimum possible number.

QUESTION:
A tuple of positive integers {x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}} is called simple if for all pairs of positive integers (i,  j) (1  ≤ i  <  j ≤ k), x_{i}  +  x_{j} is a prime.

You are given an array a with n positive integers a_1,  a_2,  ...,  a_{n} (not necessary distinct). You want to find a simple subset of the array a with the maximum size.

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Let's define a subset of the array a as a tuple that can be obtained from a by removing some (possibly all) elements of it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of integers in the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the elements of the array a.


-----Output-----

On the first line print integer m — the maximum possible size of simple subset of a.

On the second line print m integers b_{l} — the elements of the simple subset of the array a with the maximum size.

If there is more than one solution you can print any of them. You can print the elements of the subset in any order.

QUESTION:
Recently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers. The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of k + 1 consecutive ones, and then k consecutive zeroes.

Some examples of beautiful numbers:   1_2 (1_10);  110_2 (6_10);  1111000_2 (120_10);  111110000_2 (496_10). 

More formally, the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer k such that the number is equal to (2^{k} - 1) * (2^{k} - 1).

Luba has got an integer number n, and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor. Help her to find it!


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains one number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number Luba has got.


-----Output-----

Output one number — the greatest beautiful divisor of Luba's number. It is obvious that the answer always exists.

QUESTION:
Consider the decimal presentation of an integer. Let's call a number d-magic if digit d appears in decimal presentation of the number on even positions and nowhere else.

For example, the numbers 1727374, 17, 1 are 7-magic but 77, 7, 123, 34, 71 are not 7-magic. On the other hand the number 7 is 0-magic, 123 is 2-magic, 34 is 4-magic and 71 is 1-magic.

Find the number of d-magic numbers in the segment [a, b] that are multiple of m. Because the answer can be very huge you should only find its value modulo 10^9 + 7 (so you should find the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers m, d (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9) — the parameters from the problem statement.

The second line contains positive integer a in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).

The third line contains positive integer b in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).

It is guaranteed that a ≤ b, the number of digits in a and b are the same and don't exceed 2000.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer a — the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7 of the number of d-magic numbers in segment [a, b] that are multiple of m.

QUESTION:
There are n children in Jzzhu's school. Jzzhu is going to give some candies to them. Let's number all the children from 1 to n. The i-th child wants to get at least a_{i} candies.

Jzzhu asks children to line up. Initially, the i-th child stands at the i-th place of the line. Then Jzzhu start distribution of the candies. He follows the algorithm:

  Give m candies to the first child of the line.  If this child still haven't got enough candies, then the child goes to the end of the line, else the child go home.  Repeat the first two steps while the line is not empty. 

Consider all the children in the order they go home. Jzzhu wants to know, which child will be the last in this order?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ m ≤ 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, representing the number of the last child.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
1 3 1 4 2

Output
4

Input
6 4
1 1 2 2 3 3

Output
6



-----Note-----

Let's consider the first sample. 

Firstly child 1 gets 2 candies and go home. Then child 2 gets 2 candies and go to the end of the line. Currently the line looks like [3, 4, 5, 2] (indices of the children in order of the line). Then child 3 gets 2 candies and go home, and then child 4 gets 2 candies and goes to the end of the line. Currently the line looks like [5, 2, 4]. Then child 5 gets 2 candies and goes home. Then child 2 gets two candies and goes home, and finally child 4 gets 2 candies and goes home.

Child 4 is the last one who goes home.

QUESTION:
Allen has a LOT of money. He has $n$ dollars in the bank. For security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not disclose the reasons here). The denominations for dollar bills are $1$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $100$. What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output the minimum number of bills that Allen could receive.


-----Examples-----
Input
125

Output
3

Input
43

Output
5

Input
1000000000

Output
10000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a $100$ dollar bill, a $20$ dollar bill, and a $5$ dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive $125$ dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two $20$ dollar bills and three $1$ dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw $100000000$ (ten million!) $100$ dollar bills.

QUESTION:
Arkady decided to buy roses for his girlfriend.

A flower shop has white, orange and red roses, and the total amount of them is n. Arkady thinks that red roses are not good together with white roses, so he won't buy a bouquet containing both red and white roses. Also, Arkady won't buy a bouquet where all roses have the same color. 

Arkady wants to buy exactly k roses. For each rose in the shop he knows its beauty and color: the beauty of the i-th rose is b_{i}, and its color is c_{i} ('W' for a white rose, 'O' for an orange rose and 'R' for a red rose). 

Compute the maximum possible total beauty of a bouquet of k roses satisfying the constraints above or determine that it is not possible to make such a bouquet.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of roses in the show and the number of roses Arkady wants to buy.

The second line contains a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10 000), where b_{i} equals the beauty of the i-th rose.

The third line contains a string c of length n, consisting of uppercase English letters 'W', 'O' and 'R', where c_{i} denotes the color of the i-th rose: 'W' denotes white, 'O'  — orange, 'R' — red.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible total beauty of a bouquet of k roses that satisfies the constraints above. If it is not possible to make a single such bouquet, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3
4 3 4 1 6
RROWW

Output
11

Input
5 2
10 20 14 20 11
RRRRR

Output
-1

Input
11 5
5 6 3 2 3 4 7 5 4 5 6
RWOORWORROW

Output
28



-----Note-----

In the first example Arkady wants to buy 3 roses. He can, for example, buy both red roses (their indices are 1 and 2, and their total beauty is 7) and the only orange rose (its index is 3, its beauty is 4). This way the total beauty of the bouquet is 11. 

In the second example Arkady can not buy a bouquet because all roses have the same color.

QUESTION:
A continued fraction of height n is a fraction of form $a_{1} + \frac{1}{a_{2} + \frac{1}{\ldots + \frac{1}{a_{n}}}}$. You are given two rational numbers, one is represented as [Image] and the other one is represented as a finite fraction of height n. Check if they are equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers p, q (1 ≤ q ≤ p ≤ 10^18) — the numerator and the denominator of the first fraction.

The second line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 90) — the height of the second fraction. The third line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^18) — the continued fraction.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.


-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" if these fractions are equal and ""NO"" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 4
2
2 4

Output
YES

Input
9 4
3
2 3 1

Output
YES

Input
9 4

-----Note-----

In the first sample $2 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$.

In the second sample $2 + \frac{1}{3 + \frac{1}{1}} = 2 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$.

In the third sample $1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{13}{9}$.

QUESTION:
When new students come to the Specialized Educational and Scientific Centre (SESC) they need to start many things from the beginning. Sometimes the teachers say (not always unfairly) that we cannot even count. So our teachers decided to teach us arithmetics from the start. And what is the best way to teach students add and subtract? — That's right, using counting sticks! An here's our new task: 

An expression of counting sticks is an expression of type:[ A sticks][sign +][B sticks][sign =][C sticks] (1 ≤ A, B, C).  

Sign + consists of two crossed sticks: one vertical and one horizontal. Sign = consists of two horizontal sticks. The expression is arithmetically correct if A + B = C.

We've got an expression that looks like A + B = C given by counting sticks. Our task is to shift at most one stick (or we can shift nothing) so that the expression became arithmetically correct. Note that we cannot remove the sticks from the expression, also we cannot shift the sticks from the signs + and =.

We really aren't fabulous at arithmetics. Can you help us?


-----Input-----

The single line contains the initial expression. It is guaranteed that the expression looks like A + B = C, where 1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 100.


-----Output-----

If there isn't a way to shift the stick so the expression becomes correct, print on a single line ""Impossible"" (without the quotes). If there is a way, print the resulting expression. Follow the format of the output from the test samples. Don't print extra space characters.

If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them. For clarifications, you are recommended to see the test samples.


-----Examples-----
Input
||+|=|||||

Output
|||+|=||||

Input
|||||+||=||

Output
Impossible

Input
|+|=||||||

Output
Impossible

Input
||||+||=||||||

Output
||||+||=||||||



-----Note-----

In the first sample we can shift stick from the third group of sticks to the first one.

In the second sample we cannot shift vertical stick from + sign to the second group of sticks. So we cannot make a - sign.

There is no answer in the third sample because we cannot remove sticks from the expression.

In the forth sample the initial expression is already arithmetically correct and that is why we don't have to shift sticks.

QUESTION:
Snuke is introducing a robot arm with the following properties to his factory:
 - The robot arm consists of m sections and m+1 joints. The sections are numbered 1, 2, ..., m, and the joints are numbered 0, 1, ..., m. Section i connects Joint i-1 and Joint i. The length of Section i is d_i.
 - For each section, its mode can be specified individually. There are four modes: L, R, D and U. The mode of a section decides the direction of that section. If we consider the factory as a coordinate plane, the position of Joint i will be determined as follows (we denote its coordinates as (x_i, y_i)):
 - (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0).
 - If the mode of Section i is L, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} - d_{i}, y_{i-1}).
 - If the mode of Section i is R, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} + d_{i}, y_{i-1}).
 - If the mode of Section i is D, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} - d_{i}).
 - If the mode of Section i is U, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} + d_{i}).
Snuke would like to introduce a robot arm so that the position of Joint m can be matched with all of the N points (X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), ..., (X_N, Y_N) by properly specifying the modes of the sections.
Is this possible?
If so, find such a robot arm and how to bring Joint m to each point (X_j, Y_j).

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 1000
 - -10^9 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - -10^9 \leq Y_i \leq 10^9

-----Partial Score-----
 - In the test cases worth 300 points, -10 \leq X_i \leq 10 and -10 \leq Y_i \leq 10 hold.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
X_1 Y_1
X_2 Y_2
:
X_N Y_N

-----Output-----
If the condition can be satisfied, follow the following format. If the condition cannot be satisfied, print -1.
m
d_1 d_2 ... d_m
w_1
w_2
:
w_N

m and d_i are the configurations of the robot arm. Refer to the problem statement for what each of them means.
Here, 1 \leq m \leq 40 and 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^{12} must hold. Also, m and d_i must all be integers.
w_j is a string of length m that represents the way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to point (X_j, Y_j).
The i-th character of w_j should be one of the letters L, R, D and U, representing the mode of Section i.

-----Sample Input-----
3
-1 0
0 3
2 -1

-----Sample Output-----
2
1 2
RL
UU
DR

In the given way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to each (X_j, Y_j), the positions of the joints will be as follows:
 - To (X_1, Y_1) = (-1, 0): First, the position of Joint 0 is (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0). As the mode of Section 1 is R, the position of Joint 1 is (x_1, y_1) = (1, 0). Then, as the mode of Section 2 is L, the position of Joint 2 is (x_2, y_2) = (-1, 0).
 - To (X_2, Y_2) = (0, 3): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, 1), (x_2, y_2) = (0, 3).
 - To (X_3, Y_3) = (2, -1): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, -1), (x_2, y_2) = (2, -1).

QUESTION:
Polycarp has interviewed Oleg and has written the interview down without punctuation marks and spaces to save time. Thus, the interview is now a string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.

There is a filler word ogo in Oleg's speech. All words that can be obtained from ogo by adding go several times to the end of it are also considered to be fillers. For example, the words ogo, ogogo, ogogogo are fillers, but the words go, og, ogog, ogogog and oggo are not fillers.

The fillers have maximal size, for example, for ogogoo speech we can't consider ogo a filler and goo as a normal phrase. We should consider ogogo as a filler here.

To print the interview, Polycarp has to replace each of the fillers with three asterisks. Note that a filler word is replaced with exactly three asterisks regardless of its length.

Polycarp has dealt with this problem in no time. Can you do the same? The clock is ticking!


-----Input-----

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the interview.

The second line contains the string s of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.


-----Output-----

Print the interview text after the replacement of each of the fillers with ""***"". It is allowed for the substring ""***"" to have several consecutive occurences.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
aogogob

Output
a***b

Input
13
ogogmgogogogo

Output
***gmg***

Input
9
ogoogoogo

Output
*********



-----Note-----

The first sample contains one filler word ogogo, so the interview for printing is ""a***b"".

The second sample contains two fillers ogo and ogogogo. Thus, the interview is transformed to ""***gmg***"".

QUESTION:
Let's introduce some definitions that will be needed later.

Let $prime(x)$ be the set of prime divisors of $x$. For example, $prime(140) = \{ 2, 5, 7 \}$, $prime(169) = \{ 13 \}$.

Let $g(x, p)$ be the maximum possible integer $p^k$ where $k$ is an integer such that $x$ is divisible by $p^k$. For example:  $g(45, 3) = 9$ ($45$ is divisible by $3^2=9$ but not divisible by $3^3=27$),  $g(63, 7) = 7$ ($63$ is divisible by $7^1=7$ but not divisible by $7^2=49$). 

Let $f(x, y)$ be the product of $g(y, p)$ for all $p$ in $prime(x)$. For example:  $f(30, 70) = g(70, 2) \cdot g(70, 3) \cdot g(70, 5) = 2^1 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1 = 10$,  $f(525, 63) = g(63, 3) \cdot g(63, 5) \cdot g(63, 7) = 3^2 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1 = 63$. 

You have integers $x$ and $n$. Calculate $f(x, 1) \cdot f(x, 2) \cdot \ldots \cdot f(x, n) \bmod{(10^{9} + 7)}$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains integers $x$ and $n$ ($2 \le x \le 10^{9}$, $1 \le n \le 10^{18}$) — the numbers used in formula.


-----Output-----

Print the answer.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 2

Output
2

Input
20190929 1605

Output
363165664

Input
947 987654321987654321

Output
593574252



-----Note-----

In the first example, $f(10, 1) = g(1, 2) \cdot g(1, 5) = 1$, $f(10, 2) = g(2, 2) \cdot g(2, 5) = 2$.

In the second example, actual value of formula is approximately $1.597 \cdot 10^{171}$. Make sure you print the answer modulo $(10^{9} + 7)$.

In the third example, be careful about overflow issue.

QUESTION:
Little Dima misbehaved during a math lesson a lot and the nasty teacher Mr. Pickles gave him the following problem as a punishment. 

Find all integer solutions x (0 < x < 10^9) of the equation:x = b·s(x)^{a} + c,  

where a, b, c are some predetermined constant values and function s(x) determines the sum of all digits in the decimal representation of number x.

The teacher gives this problem to Dima for each lesson. He changes only the parameters of the equation: a, b, c. Dima got sick of getting bad marks and he asks you to help him solve this challenging problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three space-separated integers: a, b, c (1 ≤ a ≤ 5; 1 ≤ b ≤ 10000;  - 10000 ≤ c ≤ 10000).


-----Output-----

Print integer n — the number of the solutions that you've found. Next print n integers in the increasing order — the solutions of the given equation. Print only integer solutions that are larger than zero and strictly less than 10^9.

QUESTION:
During the breaks between competitions, top-model Izabella tries to develop herself and not to be bored. For example, now she tries to solve Rubik's cube 2x2x2.

It's too hard to learn to solve Rubik's cube instantly, so she learns to understand if it's possible to solve the cube in some state using 90-degrees rotation of one face of the cube in any direction.

To check her answers she wants to use a program which will for some state of cube tell if it's possible to solve it using one rotation, described above.

Cube is called solved if for each face of cube all squares on it has the same color.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube


-----Input-----

In first line given a sequence of 24 integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 6), where a_{i} denotes color of i-th square. There are exactly 4 occurrences of all colors in this sequence.


-----Output-----

Print «YES» (without quotes) if it's possible to solve cube using one rotation and «NO» (without quotes) otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 5 4 6 1 3 6 2 5 5 1 2 3 5 3 1 1 2 4 6 6 4 3 4

Output
NO
Input
5 3 5 3 2 5 2 5 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 6 3 6 3

Output
YES


-----Note-----

In first test case cube looks like this: [Image] 

In second test case cube looks like this:  [Image] 

It's possible to solve cube by rotating face with squares with numbers 13, 14, 15, 16.

QUESTION:
Not so long ago the Codecraft-17 contest was held on Codeforces. The top 25 participants, and additionally random 25 participants out of those who got into top 500, will receive a Codeforces T-shirt.

Unfortunately, you didn't manage to get into top 25, but you got into top 500, taking place p.

Now the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017 is being held. It has been announced that the Codecraft-17 T-shirt winners will be chosen as follows. Let s be the number of points of the winner of the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017. Then the following pseudocode will be executed: 

i := (s div 50) mod 475

repeat 25 times:

    i := (i * 96 + 42) mod 475

    print (26 + i)



Here ""div"" is the integer division operator, ""mod"" is the modulo (the remainder of division) operator.

As the result of pseudocode execution, 25 integers between 26 and 500, inclusive, will be printed. These will be the numbers of places of the participants who get the Codecraft-17 T-shirts. It is guaranteed that the 25 printed integers will be pairwise distinct for any value of s.

You're in the lead of the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017, having x points. You believe that having at least y points in the current round will be enough for victory.

To change your final score, you can make any number of successful and unsuccessful hacks. A successful hack brings you 100 points, an unsuccessful one takes 50 points from you. It's difficult to do successful hacks, though.

You want to win the current round and, at the same time, ensure getting a Codecraft-17 T-shirt. What is the smallest number of successful hacks you have to do to achieve that?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers p, x and y (26 ≤ p ≤ 500; 1 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ 20000) — your place in Codecraft-17, your current score in the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017, and the smallest number of points you consider sufficient for winning the current round.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of successful hacks you have to do in order to both win the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017 and ensure getting a Codecraft-17 T-shirt.

It's guaranteed that your goal is achievable for any valid input data.


-----Examples-----
Input
239 10880 9889

Output
0

Input
26 7258 6123

Output
2

Input
493 8000 8000

Output
24

Input
101 6800 6500

Output
0

Input
329 19913 19900

Output
8



-----Note-----

In the first example, there is no need to do any hacks since 10880 points already bring the T-shirt to the 239-th place of Codecraft-17 (that is, you). In this case, according to the pseudocode, the T-shirts will be given to the participants at the following places: 

475 422 84 411 453 210 157 294 146 188 420 367 29 356 398 155 102 239 91 133 365 312 449 301 343



In the second example, you have to do two successful and one unsuccessful hack to make your score equal to 7408.

In the third example, you need to do as many as 24 successful hacks to make your score equal to 10400.

In the fourth example, it's sufficient to do 6 unsuccessful hacks (and no successful ones) to make your score equal to 6500, which is just enough for winning the current round and also getting the T-shirt.

QUESTION:
Winnie-the-Pooh likes honey very much! That is why he decided to visit his friends. Winnie has got three best friends: Rabbit, Owl and Eeyore, each of them lives in his own house. There are winding paths between each pair of houses. The length of a path between Rabbit's and Owl's houses is a meters, between Rabbit's and Eeyore's house is b meters, between Owl's and Eeyore's house is c meters.

For enjoying his life and singing merry songs Winnie-the-Pooh should have a meal n times a day. Now he is in the Rabbit's house and has a meal for the first time. Each time when in the friend's house where Winnie is now the supply of honey is about to end, Winnie leaves that house. If Winnie has not had a meal the required amount of times, he comes out from the house and goes to someone else of his two friends. For this he chooses one of two adjacent paths, arrives to the house on the other end and visits his friend. You may assume that when Winnie is eating in one of his friend's house, the supply of honey in other friend's houses recover (most probably, they go to the supply store).

Winnie-the-Pooh does not like physical activity. He wants to have a meal n times, traveling minimum possible distance. Help him to find this distance.


-----Input-----

First line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of visits.

Second line contains an integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 100) — distance between Rabbit's and Owl's houses.

Third line contains an integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 100) — distance between Rabbit's and Eeyore's houses.

Fourth line contains an integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 100) — distance between Owl's and Eeyore's houses.


-----Output-----

Output one number — minimum distance in meters Winnie must go through to have a meal n times.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
2
3
1

Output
3

Input
1
2
3
5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test case the optimal path for Winnie is the following: first have a meal in Rabbit's house, then in Owl's house, then in Eeyore's house. Thus he will pass the distance 2 + 1 = 3.

In the second test case Winnie has a meal in Rabbit's house and that is for him. So he doesn't have to walk anywhere at all.

QUESTION:
There are three friend living on the straight line Ox in Lineland. The first friend lives at the point x_1, the second friend lives at the point x_2, and the third friend lives at the point x_3. They plan to celebrate the New Year together, so they need to meet at one point. What is the minimum total distance they have to travel in order to meet at some point and celebrate the New Year?

It's guaranteed that the optimal answer is always integer.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three distinct integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2, x_3 ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the houses of the first, the second and the third friends respectively. 


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum total distance the friends need to travel in order to meet together.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 1 4

Output
6

Input
30 20 10

Output
20



-----Note-----

In the first sample, friends should meet at the point 4. Thus, the first friend has to travel the distance of 3 (from the point 7 to the point 4), the second friend also has to travel the distance of 3 (from the point 1 to the point 4), while the third friend should not go anywhere because he lives at the point 4.

QUESTION:
There is an array with n elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} and the number x.

In one operation you can select some i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and replace element a_{i} with a_{i} & x, where & denotes the bitwise and operation.

You want the array to have at least two equal elements after applying some operations (possibly, none). In other words, there should be at least two distinct indices i ≠ j such that a_{i} = a_{j}. Determine whether it is possible to achieve and, if possible, the minimal number of operations to apply.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integers n and x (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100 000), number of elements in the array and the number to and with.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100 000), the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the minimal number of operations to do, or -1, if it is impossible.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3
1 2 3 7

Output
1

Input
2 228
1 1

Output
0

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example one can apply the operation to the last element of the array. That replaces 7 with 3, so we achieve the goal in one move.

In the second example the array already has two equal elements.

In the third example applying the operation won't change the array at all, so it is impossible to make some pair of elements equal.

QUESTION:
You have a given picture with size $w \times h$. Determine if the given picture has a single ""+"" shape or not. A ""+"" shape is described below:

  A ""+"" shape has one center nonempty cell.  There should be some (at least one) consecutive non-empty cells in each direction (left, right, up, down) from the center. In other words, there should be a ray in each direction.  All other cells are empty. 

Find out if the given picture has single ""+"" shape.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $h$ and $w$ ($1 \le h$, $w \le 500$) — the height and width of the picture.

The $i$-th of the next $h$ lines contains string $s_{i}$ of length $w$ consisting ""."" and ""*"" where ""."" denotes the empty space and ""*"" denotes the non-empty space.


-----Output-----

If the given picture satisfies all conditions, print ""YES"". Otherwise, print ""NO"".

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
......
..*...
.****.
..*...

-----Note-----

In the first example, the given picture contains one ""+"".

In the second example, two vertical branches are located in a different column.

In the third example, there is a dot outside of the shape.

In the fourth example, the width of the two vertical branches is $2$.

In the fifth example, there are two shapes.

In the sixth example, there is an empty space inside of the shape.

QUESTION:
Given three numbers $n, a, b$. You need to find an adjacency matrix of such an undirected graph that the number of components in it is equal to $a$, and the number of components in its complement is $b$. The matrix must be symmetric, and all digits on the main diagonal must be zeroes.

In an undirected graph loops (edges from a vertex to itself) are not allowed. It can be at most one edge between a pair of vertices.

The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is a square matrix of size $n$ consisting only of ""0"" and ""1"", where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph and the $i$-th row and the $i$-th column correspond to the $i$-th vertex of the graph. The cell $(i,j)$ of the adjacency matrix contains $1$ if and only if the $i$-th and $j$-th vertices in the graph are connected by an edge.

A connected component is a set of vertices $X$ such that for every two vertices from this set there exists at least one path in the graph connecting this pair of vertices, but adding any other vertex to $X$ violates this rule.

The complement or inverse of a graph $G$ is a graph $H$ on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in $G$.


-----Input-----

In a single line, three numbers are given $n, a, b \,(1 \le n \le 1000, 1 \le a, b \le n)$: is the number of vertexes of the graph, the required number of connectivity components in it, and the required amount of the connectivity component in it's complement. 


-----Output-----

If there is no graph that satisfies these constraints on a single line, print ""NO"" (without quotes).

Otherwise, on the first line, print ""YES""(without quotes). In each of the next $n$ lines, output $n$ digits such that $j$-th digit of $i$-th line must be $1$ if and only if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$ (and $0$ otherwise). Note that the matrix must be symmetric, and all digits on the main diagonal must be zeroes. 

If there are several matrices that satisfy the conditions — output any of them.

QUESTION:
The finalists of the ""Russian Code Cup"" competition in 2214 will be the participants who win in one of the elimination rounds.

The elimination rounds are divided into main and additional. Each of the main elimination rounds consists of c problems, the winners of the round are the first n people in the rating list. Each of the additional elimination rounds consists of d problems. The winner of the additional round is one person. Besides, k winners of the past finals are invited to the finals without elimination.

As a result of all elimination rounds at least n·m people should go to the finals. You need to organize elimination rounds in such a way, that at least n·m people go to the finals, and the total amount of used problems in all rounds is as small as possible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100) — the number of problems in the main and additional rounds, correspondingly. The second line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Finally, the third line contains an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of the pre-chosen winners. 


-----Output-----

In the first line, print a single integer — the minimum number of problems the jury needs to prepare.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
Let’s define a grid to be a set of tiles with 2 rows and 13 columns. Each tile has an English letter written in it. The letters don't have to be unique: there might be two or more tiles with the same letter written on them. Here is an example of a grid: ABCDEFGHIJKLM

NOPQRSTUVWXYZ 

We say that two tiles are adjacent if they share a side or a corner. In the example grid above, the tile with the letter 'A' is adjacent only to the tiles with letters 'B', 'N', and 'O'. A tile is not adjacent to itself.

A sequence of tiles is called a path if each tile in the sequence is adjacent to the tile which follows it (except for the last tile in the sequence, which of course has no successor). In this example, ""ABC"" is a path, and so is ""KXWIHIJK"". ""MAB"" is not a path because 'M' is not adjacent to 'A'. A single tile can be used more than once by a path (though the tile cannot occupy two consecutive places in the path because no tile is adjacent to itself).

You’re given a string s which consists of 27 upper-case English letters. Each English letter occurs at least once in s. Find a grid that contains a path whose tiles, viewed in the order that the path visits them, form the string s. If there’s no solution, print ""Impossible"" (without the quotes).


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains the string s, consisting of 27 upper-case English letters. Each English letter occurs at least once in s.


-----Output-----

Output two lines, each consisting of 13 upper-case English characters, representing the rows of the grid. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution print ""Impossible"".


-----Examples-----
Input
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSGTUVWXYZ

Output
YXWVUTGHIJKLM
ZABCDEFSRQPON

QUESTION:
Year 2118. Androids are in mass production for decades now, and they do all the work for humans. But androids have to go to school to be able to solve creative tasks. Just like humans before.

It turns out that high school struggles are not gone. If someone is not like others, he is bullied. Vasya-8800 is an economy-class android which is produced by a little-known company. His design is not perfect, his characteristics also could be better. So he is bullied by other androids.

One of the popular pranks on Vasya is to force him to compare $x^y$ with $y^x$. Other androids can do it in milliseconds while Vasya's memory is too small to store such big numbers.

Please help Vasya! Write a fast program to compare $x^y$ with $y^x$ for Vasya, maybe then other androids will respect him.


-----Input-----

On the only line of input there are two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le 10^{9}$).


-----Output-----

If $x^y < y^x$, then print '<' (without quotes). If $x^y > y^x$, then print '>' (without quotes). If $x^y = y^x$, then print '=' (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 8

Output
>

Input
10 3

Output
<

Input
6 6

Output
=



-----Note-----

In the first example $5^8 = 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 390625$, and $8^5 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32768$. So you should print '>'.

In the second example $10^3 = 1000 < 3^{10} = 59049$.

In the third example $6^6 = 46656 = 6^6$.

QUESTION:
A girl named Xenia has a cupboard that looks like an arc from ahead. The arc is made of a semicircle with radius r (the cupboard's top) and two walls of height h (the cupboard's sides). The cupboard's depth is r, that is, it looks like a rectangle with base r and height h + r from the sides. The figure below shows what the cupboard looks like (the front view is on the left, the side view is on the right). [Image] 

Xenia got lots of balloons for her birthday. The girl hates the mess, so she wants to store the balloons in the cupboard. Luckily, each balloon is a sphere with radius $\frac{r}{2}$. Help Xenia calculate the maximum number of balloons she can put in her cupboard. 

You can say that a balloon is in the cupboard if you can't see any part of the balloon on the left or right view. The balloons in the cupboard can touch each other. It is not allowed to squeeze the balloons or deform them in any way. You can assume that the cupboard's walls are negligibly thin.


-----Input-----

The single line contains two integers r, h (1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10^7).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of balloons Xenia can put in the cupboard.


-----Examples-----

QUESTION:
A little bear Limak plays a game. He has five cards. There is one number written on each card. Each number is a positive integer.

Limak can discard (throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on remaining (not discarded) cards.

He is allowed to at most once discard two or three cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's impossible to choose two or three cards with the same number.

Given five numbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains five integers t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 and t_5 (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on cards.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum possible sum of numbers written on remaining cards.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 3 7 3 20

Output
26

Input
7 9 3 1 8

Output
28

Input
10 10 10 10 10

Output
20



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers 7, 3, 7, 3 and 20. Limak can do one of the following.

  Do nothing and the sum would be 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 20 = 40.  Remove two cards with a number 7. The remaining sum would be 3 + 3 + 20 = 26.  Remove two cards with a number 3. The remaining sum would be 7 + 7 + 20 = 34. 

You are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is 26.

In the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28.

In the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum of two remaining numbers is 10 + 10 = 20.

QUESTION:
Vasya takes part in the orienteering competition. There are n checkpoints located along the line at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. Vasya starts at the point with coordinate a. His goal is to visit at least n - 1 checkpoint in order to finish the competition. Participant are allowed to visit checkpoints in arbitrary order.

Vasya wants to pick such checkpoints and the order of visiting them that the total distance travelled is minimized. He asks you to calculate this minimum possible value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and a (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000,  - 1 000 000 ≤ a ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of checkpoints and Vasya's starting position respectively.

The second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} ( - 1 000 000 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 1 000 000) — coordinates of the checkpoints.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum distance Vasya has to travel in order to visit at least n - 1 checkpoint.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10
1 7 12

Output
7

Input
2 0
11 -10

Output
10

Input
5 0
0 0 1000 0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample Vasya has to visit at least two checkpoints. The optimal way to achieve this is the walk to the third checkpoints (distance is 12 - 10 = 2) and then proceed to the second one (distance is 12 - 7 = 5). The total distance is equal to 2 + 5 = 7.

In the second sample it's enough to visit only one checkpoint so Vasya should just walk to the point  - 10.

QUESTION:
Let's consider equation:x^2 + s(x)·x - n = 0,  

where x, n are positive integers, s(x) is the function, equal to the sum of digits of number x in the decimal number system.

You are given an integer n, find the smallest positive integer root of equation x, or else determine that there are no such roots.


-----Input-----

A single line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the equation parameter.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. 


-----Output-----

Print -1, if the equation doesn't have integer positive roots. Otherwise print such smallest integer x (x > 0), that the equation given in the statement holds.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
110

Output
10

Input
4

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test case x = 1 is the minimum root. As s(1) = 1 and 1^2 + 1·1 - 2 = 0.

In the second test case x = 10 is the minimum root. As s(10) = 1 + 0 = 1 and 10^2 + 1·10 - 110 = 0.

In the third test case the equation has no roots.

QUESTION:
George woke up and saw the current time s on the digital clock. Besides, George knows that he has slept for time t. 

Help George! Write a program that will, given time s and t, determine the time p when George went to bed. Note that George could have gone to bed yesterday relatively to the current time (see the second test sample). 


-----Input-----

The first line contains current time s as a string in the format ""hh:mm"". The second line contains time t in the format ""hh:mm"" — the duration of George's sleep. It is guaranteed that the input contains the correct time in the 24-hour format, that is, 00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59.

In the first sample George went to bed at ""00:06"". Note that you should print the time only in the format ""00:06"". That's why answers ""0:06"", ""00:6"" and others will be considered incorrect. 

In the second sample, George went to bed yesterday.

QUESTION:
You are given array $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. Find the subsegment $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) with maximum arithmetic mean $\frac{1}{r - l + 1}\sum\limits_{i=l}^{r}{a_i}$ (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — length of the array $a$.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the array $a$.


-----Output-----

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.


-----Example-----
Input
5
6 1 6 6 0

Output
2



-----Note-----

The subsegment $[3, 4]$ is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.

QUESTION:
On his free time, Chouti likes doing some housework. He has got one new task, paint some bricks in the yard.

There are $n$ bricks lined in a row on the ground. Chouti has got $m$ paint buckets of different colors at hand, so he painted each brick in one of those $m$ colors.

Having finished painting all bricks, Chouti was satisfied. He stood back and decided to find something fun with these bricks. After some counting, he found there are $k$ bricks with a color different from the color of the brick on its left (the first brick is not counted, for sure).

So as usual, he needs your help in counting how many ways could he paint the bricks. Two ways of painting bricks are different if there is at least one brick painted in different colors in these two ways. Because the answer might be quite big, you only need to output the number of ways modulo $998\,244\,353$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n,m \leq 2000, 0 \leq k \leq n-1$) — the number of bricks, the number of colors, and the number of bricks, such that its color differs from the color of brick to the left of it.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of ways to color bricks modulo $998\,244\,353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 0

Output
3

Input
3 2 1

Output
4



-----Note-----

In the first example, since $k=0$, the color of every brick should be the same, so there will be exactly $m=3$ ways to color the bricks.

In the second example, suppose the two colors in the buckets are yellow and lime, the following image shows all $4$ possible colorings. [Image]

QUESTION:
Dima and Inna are doing so great! At the moment, Inna is sitting on the magic lawn playing with a pink pony. Dima wanted to play too. He brought an n × m chessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers a and b.

Dima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (i, j) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:

  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y - b);  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y - b);  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y + b);  move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y + b). 

Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.

Inna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (i, j) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task! 


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains six integers n, m, i, j, a, b (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6; 1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6).

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Position (i, j) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1).


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.

If Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's rules, print on a single line ""Poor Inna and pony!"" without the quotes.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 7 1 3 2 2

Output
2

Input
5 5 2 3 1 1

Output
Poor Inna and pony!



-----Note-----

Note to sample 1:

Inna and the pony can move the candy to position (1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 + 2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7). These positions correspond to the corner squares of the chess board. Thus, the answer to the test sample equals two.

QUESTION:
You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of $s$ be $|s|$. You may perform several operations on this string.

In one operation, you can choose some index $i$ and remove the $i$-th character of $s$ ($s_i$) if at least one of its adjacent characters is the previous letter in the Latin alphabet for $s_i$. For example, the previous letter for b is a, the previous letter for s is r, the letter a has no previous letters. Note that after each removal the length of the string decreases by one. So, the index $i$ should satisfy the condition $1 \le i \le |s|$ during each operation.

For the character $s_i$ adjacent characters are $s_{i-1}$ and $s_{i+1}$. The first and the last characters of $s$ both have only one adjacent character (unless $|s| = 1$).

Consider the following example. Let $s=$ bacabcab.  During the first move, you can remove the first character $s_1=$ b because $s_2=$ a. Then the string becomes $s=$ acabcab.  During the second move, you can remove the fifth character $s_5=$ c because $s_4=$ b. Then the string becomes $s=$ acabab.  During the third move, you can remove the sixth character $s_6=$'b' because $s_5=$ a. Then the string becomes $s=$ acaba.  During the fourth move, the only character you can remove is $s_4=$ b, because $s_3=$ a (or $s_5=$ a). The string becomes $s=$ acaa and you cannot do anything with it. 

Your task is to find the maximum possible number of characters you can remove if you choose the sequence of operations optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $|s|$ ($1 \le |s| \le 100$) — the length of $s$.

The second line of the input contains one string $s$ consisting of $|s|$ lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of characters you can remove if you choose the sequence of moves optimally.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
bacabcab

Output
4

Input
4
bcda

Output
3

Input
6
abbbbb

Output
5



-----Note-----

The first example is described in the problem statement. Note that the sequence of moves provided in the statement is not the only, but it can be shown that the maximum possible answer to this test is $4$.

In the second example, you can remove all but one character of $s$. The only possible answer follows.  During the first move, remove the third character $s_3=$ d, $s$ becomes bca.  During the second move, remove the second character $s_2=$ c, $s$ becomes ba.  And during the third move, remove the first character $s_1=$ b, $s$ becomes a.

QUESTION:
ATMs of a well-known bank of a small country are arranged so that they can not give any amount of money requested by the user. Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at most k bills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.

For example, if a country uses bills with denominations 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 burles, then at k = 20 such ATM can give sums 100 000 burles and 96 000 burles, but it cannot give sums 99 000 and 101 000 burles.

Let's suppose that the country uses bills of n distinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cash q times. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20).

The next line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^7) — the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers a_{i} follow in the strictly increasing order.

The next line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 20) — the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.

The next q lines contain numbers x_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 2·10^8) — the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.


-----Output-----

For each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.

QUESTION:
The tram in Berland goes along a straight line from the point 0 to the point s and back, passing 1 meter per t_1 seconds in both directions. It means that the tram is always in the state of uniform rectilinear motion, instantly turning around at points x = 0 and x = s.

Igor is at the point x_1. He should reach the point x_2. Igor passes 1 meter per t_2 seconds. 

Your task is to determine the minimum time Igor needs to get from the point x_1 to the point x_2, if it is known where the tram is and in what direction it goes at the moment Igor comes to the point x_1.

Igor can enter the tram unlimited number of times at any moment when his and the tram's positions coincide. It is not obligatory that points in which Igor enter and exit the tram are integers. Assume that any boarding and unboarding happens instantly. Igor can move arbitrary along the line (but not faster than 1 meter per t_2 seconds). He can also stand at some point for some time.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers s, x_1 and x_2 (2 ≤ s ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ s, x_1 ≠ x_2) — the maximum coordinate of the point to which the tram goes, the point Igor is at, and the point he should come to.

The second line contains two integers t_1 and t_2 (1 ≤ t_1, t_2 ≤ 1000) — the time in seconds in which the tram passes 1 meter and the time in seconds in which Igor passes 1 meter.

The third line contains two integers p and d (1 ≤ p ≤ s - 1, d is either 1 or $- 1$) — the position of the tram in the moment Igor came to the point x_1 and the direction of the tram at this moment. If $d = - 1$, the tram goes in the direction from the point s to the point 0. If d = 1, the tram goes in the direction from the point 0 to the point s.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum time in seconds which Igor needs to get from the point x_1 to the point x_2.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2 4
3 4
1 1

Output
8

Input
5 4 0
1 2
3 1

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example it is profitable for Igor to go by foot and not to wait the tram. Thus, he has to pass 2 meters and it takes 8 seconds in total, because he passes 1 meter per 4 seconds. 

In the second example Igor can, for example, go towards the point x_2 and get to the point 1 in 6 seconds (because he has to pass 3 meters, but he passes 1 meters per 2 seconds). At that moment the tram will be at the point 1, so Igor can enter the tram and pass 1 meter in 1 second. Thus, Igor will reach the point x_2 in 7 seconds in total.

QUESTION:
Innokentiy decides to change the password in the social net ""Contact!"", but he is too lazy to invent a new password by himself. That is why he needs your help. 

Innokentiy decides that new password should satisfy the following conditions:  the length of the password must be equal to n,  the password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters,  the number of distinct symbols in the password must be equal to k,  any two consecutive symbols in the password must be distinct. 

Your task is to help Innokentiy and to invent a new password which will satisfy all given conditions. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ min(n, 26)) — the length of the password and the number of distinct symbols in it. 

Pay attention that a desired new password always exists.


-----Output-----

Print any password which satisfies all conditions given by Innokentiy.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3

Output
java

Input
6 6

Output
python

Input
5 2

Output
phphp



-----Note-----

In the first test there is one of the appropriate new passwords — java, because its length is equal to 4 and 3 distinct lowercase letters a, j and v are used in it.

In the second test there is one of the appropriate new passwords — python, because its length is equal to 6 and it consists of 6 distinct lowercase letters.

In the third test there is one of the appropriate new passwords — phphp, because its length is equal to 5 and 2 distinct lowercase letters p and h are used in it.

Pay attention the condition that no two identical symbols are consecutive is correct for all appropriate passwords in tests.

QUESTION:
There will be a launch of a new, powerful and unusual collider very soon, which located along a straight line. n particles will be launched inside it. All of them are located in a straight line and there can not be two or more particles located in the same point. The coordinates of the particles coincide with the distance in meters from the center of the collider, x_{i} is the coordinate of the i-th particle and its position in the collider at the same time. All coordinates of particle positions are even integers.

You know the direction of each particle movement — it will move to the right or to the left after the collider's launch start. All particles begin to move simultaneously at the time of the collider's launch start. Each particle will move straight to the left or straight to the right with the constant speed of 1 meter per microsecond. The collider is big enough so particles can not leave it in the foreseeable time.

Write the program which finds the moment of the first collision of any two particles of the collider. In other words, find the number of microseconds before the first moment when any two particles are at the same point.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of particles. 

The second line contains n symbols ""L"" and ""R"". If the i-th symbol equals ""L"", then the i-th particle will move to the left, otherwise the i-th symbol equals ""R"" and the i-th particle will move to the right.

The third line contains the sequence of pairwise distinct even integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the coordinates of particles in the order from the left to the right. It is guaranteed that the coordinates of particles are given in the increasing order. 


-----Output-----

In the first line print the only integer — the first moment (in microseconds) when two particles are at the same point and there will be an explosion. 

Print the only integer -1, if the collision of particles doesn't happen. 


-----Examples-----
Input
4
RLRL
2 4 6 10

Output
1

Input
3
LLR
40 50 60

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample case the first explosion will happen in 1 microsecond because the particles number 1 and 2 will simultaneously be at the same point with the coordinate 3. 

In the second sample case there will be no explosion because there are no particles which will simultaneously be at the same point.

QUESTION:
One very important person has a piece of paper in the form of a rectangle a × b.

Also, he has n seals. Each seal leaves an impression on the paper in the form of a rectangle of the size x_{i} × y_{i}. Each impression must be parallel to the sides of the piece of paper (but seal can be rotated by 90 degrees).

A very important person wants to choose two different seals and put them two impressions. Each of the selected seals puts exactly one impression. Impressions should not overlap (but they can touch sides), and the total area occupied by them should be the largest possible. What is the largest area that can be occupied by two seals?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, a and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 100).

Each of the next n lines contain two numbers x_{i}, y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

Print the largest total area that can be occupied by two seals. If you can not select two seals, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 2
1 2
2 1

Output
4

Input
4 10 9
2 3
1 1
5 10
9 11

Output
56

Input
3 10 10
6 6
7 7
20 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can rotate the second seal by 90 degrees. Then put impression of it right under the impression of the first seal. This will occupy all the piece of paper.

In the second example you can't choose the last seal because it doesn't fit. By choosing the first and the third seals you occupy the largest area.

In the third example there is no such pair of seals that they both can fit on a piece of paper.

QUESTION:
The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10$).

Each of the following $4n + 1$ lines contains two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($0 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 50$), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least $n$ points on each side of the square and all $4n + 1$ points are distinct.


-----Output-----

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 0
1 1
1 2
2 0
2 1
2 2

Output

Input

0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3
1 0

2 0
2 1
2 2

Output
0 3



-----Note-----

In both examples, the square has four sides $x=0$, $x=2$, $y=0$, $y=2$.

QUESTION:
Awruk is taking part in elections in his school. It is the final round. He has only one opponent — Elodreip. The are $n$ students in the school. Each student has exactly $k$ votes and is obligated to use all of them. So Awruk knows that if a person gives $a_i$ votes for Elodreip, than he will get exactly $k - a_i$ votes from this person. Of course $0 \le k - a_i$ holds.

Awruk knows that if he loses his life is over. He has been speaking a lot with his friends and now he knows $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ — how many votes for Elodreip each student wants to give. Now he wants to change the number $k$ to win the elections. Of course he knows that bigger $k$ means bigger chance that somebody may notice that he has changed something and then he will be disqualified.

So, Awruk knows $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ — how many votes each student will give to his opponent. Help him select the smallest winning number $k$. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of students in the school.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 100$) — the number of votes each student gives to Elodreip.


-----Output-----

Output the smallest integer $k$ ($k \ge \max a_i$) which gives Awruk the victory. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 1 1 5 1

Output
5
Input
5
2 2 3 2 2

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example, Elodreip gets $1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9$ votes. The smallest possible $k$ is $5$ (it surely can't be less due to the fourth person), and it leads to $4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 16$ votes for Awruk, which is enough to win.

In the second example, Elodreip gets $11$ votes. If $k = 4$, Awruk gets $9$ votes and loses to Elodreip.

QUESTION:
You are given a set of points on a straight line. Each point has a color assigned to it. For point a, its neighbors are the points which don't have any other points between them and a. Each point has at most two neighbors - one from the left and one from the right.

You perform a sequence of operations on this set of points. In one operation, you delete all points which have a neighbor point of a different color than the point itself. Points are deleted simultaneously, i.e. first you decide which points have to be deleted and then delete them. After that you can perform the next operation etc. If an operation would not delete any points, you can't perform it.

How many operations will you need to perform until the next operation does not have any points to delete?


-----Input-----

Input contains a single string of lowercase English letters 'a'-'z'. The letters give the points' colors in the order in which they are arranged on the line: the first letter gives the color of the leftmost point, the second gives the color of the second point from the left etc.

The number of the points is between 1 and 10^6.


-----Output-----

Output one line containing an integer - the number of operations which can be performed on the given set of points until there are no more points to delete.


-----Examples-----
Input
aabb

Output
2

Input
aabcaa

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first test case, the first operation will delete two middle points and leave points ""ab"", which will be deleted with the second operation. There will be no points left to apply the third operation to.

In the second test case, the first operation will delete the four points in the middle, leaving points ""aa"". None of them have neighbors of other colors, so the second operation can't be applied.

The first line of input contains a positive integer number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements in array a. The second line contains n positive integer numbers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of a given array.


-----Output-----

Print one number — the quantity of triples (i,  j,  k) such that i,  j and k are pairwise distinct and a_{i}·a_{j}·a_{k} is minimum possible.

-----Note-----

In the first example Makes always chooses three ones out of four, and the number of ways to choose them is 4.

In the second example a triple of numbers (1, 2, 3) is chosen (numbers, not indices). Since there are two ways to choose an element 3, then the answer is 2.

In the third example a triple of numbers (1, 1, 2) is chosen, and there's only one way to choose indices.

QUESTION:
Katie, Kuro and Shiro are best friends. They have known each other since kindergarten. That's why they often share everything with each other and work together on some very hard problems.

Today is Shiro's birthday. She really loves pizza so she wants to invite her friends to the pizza restaurant near her house to celebrate her birthday, including her best friends Katie and Kuro.

She has ordered a very big round pizza, in order to serve her many friends. Exactly $n$ of Shiro's friends are here. That's why she has to divide the pizza into $n + 1$ slices (Shiro also needs to eat). She wants the slices to be exactly the same size and shape. If not, some of her friends will get mad and go home early, and the party will be over.

Shiro is now hungry. She wants to cut the pizza with minimum of straight cuts. A cut is a straight segment, it might have ends inside or outside the pizza. But she is too lazy to pick up the calculator.

As usual, she will ask Katie and Kuro for help. But they haven't come yet. Could you help Shiro with this problem?


-----Input-----

A single line contains one non-negative integer $n$ ($0 \le n \leq 10^{18}$) — the number of Shiro's friends. The circular pizza has to be sliced into $n + 1$ pieces.


-----Output-----

A single integer — the number of straight cuts Shiro needs.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
2
Input
4

Output
5


-----Note-----

To cut the round pizza into quarters one has to make two cuts through the center with angle $90^{\circ}$ between them.

To cut the round pizza into five equal parts one has to make five cuts.

QUESTION:
Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.

Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya's bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.

Ilya is not very good at math, and that's why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank's gift.


-----Input-----

The single line contains integer n (10 ≤ |n| ≤ 10^9) — the state of Ilya's bank account.


-----Output-----

In a single line print an integer — the maximum state of the bank account that Ilya can get. 


-----Examples-----
Input
2230

Output
2230

Input
-10

Output
0

Input
-100003

Output
-10000



-----Note-----

In the first test sample Ilya doesn't profit from using the present.

In the second test sample you can delete digit 1 and get the state of the account equal to 0.

QUESTION:
[Image] 

Walking through the streets of Marshmallow City, Slastyona have spotted some merchants selling a kind of useless toy which is very popular nowadays – caramel spinner! Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.

Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

 [Image] 

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly n seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.


-----Input-----

There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), < (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or > (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.

In the second strings, a single number n is given (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) – the duration of the rotation.

It is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a n second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.


-----Output-----

Output cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw – if counter-clockwise, and undefined otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
^ >
1

Output
cw

Input
< ^
3

Output
ccw

Input
^ v
6

Output
undefined

QUESTION:
Little Chris knows there's no fun in playing dominoes, he thinks it's too random and doesn't require skill. Instead, he decided to play with the dominoes and make a ""domino show"".

Chris arranges n dominoes in a line, placing each piece vertically upright. In the beginning, he simultaneously pushes some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. However, somewhere between every two dominoes pushed in the same direction there is at least one domino pushed in the opposite direction.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows one possible example of the process. [Image] 

Given the initial directions Chris has pushed the dominoes, find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically at the end of the process!


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a character string s of length n. The i-th character of the string s_{i} is equal to   ""L"", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;  ""R"", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;  ""."", if the i-th domino has not been pushed. 

It is guaranteed that if s_{i} = s_{j} = ""L"" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and s_{k} = ""R""; if s_{i} = s_{j} = ""R"" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and s_{k} = ""L"".


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the number of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process.


-----Examples-----
Input
14
.L.R...LR..L..

Output
4

Input
5
R....

Output
0

Input
1
.

Output
1



-----Note-----

The first example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces that remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange.

In the second example case, all pieces fall down since the first piece topples all the other pieces.

In the last example case, a single piece has not been pushed in either direction.

QUESTION:
n children are standing in a circle and playing a game. Children's numbers in clockwise order form a permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of length n. It is an integer sequence such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.

The game consists of m steps. On each step the current leader with index i counts out a_{i} people in clockwise order, starting from the next person. The last one to be pointed at by the leader becomes the new leader.

You are given numbers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} — indices of leaders in the beginning of each step. Child with number l_1 is the first leader in the game. 

Write a program which will restore a possible permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. If there are multiple solutions then print any of them. If there is no solution then print -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

The second line contains m integer numbers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ n) — indices of leaders in the beginning of each step.


-----Output-----

Print such permutation of n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} that leaders in the game will be exactly l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} if all the rules are followed. If there are multiple solutions print any of them. 

If there is no permutation which satisfies all described conditions print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 5
2 3 1 4 4

Output
3 1 2 4 

Input
3 3
3 1 2

Output
-1



-----Note-----

Let's follow leadership in the first example:   Child 2 starts.  Leadership goes from 2 to 2 + a_2 = 3.  Leadership goes from 3 to 3 + a_3 = 5. As it's greater than 4, it's going in a circle to 1.  Leadership goes from 1 to 1 + a_1 = 4.  Leadership goes from 4 to 4 + a_4 = 8. Thus in circle it still remains at 4.

QUESTION:
Petya is preparing for IQ test and he has noticed that there many problems like: you are given a sequence, find the next number. Now Petya can solve only problems with arithmetic or geometric progressions.

Arithmetic progression is a sequence a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, ..., a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 and d are any numbers.

Geometric progression is a sequence b_1, b_2 = b_1q, ..., b_{n} = b_{n} - 1q, where b_1 ≠ 0, q ≠ 0, q ≠ 1. 

Help Petya and write a program to determine if the given sequence is arithmetic or geometric. Also it should found the next number. If the sequence is neither arithmetic nor geometric, print 42 (he thinks it is impossible to find better answer). You should also print 42 if the next element of progression is not integer. So answer is always integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains exactly four integer numbers between 1 and 1000, inclusively.


-----Output-----

Print the required number. If the given sequence is arithmetic progression, print the next progression element. Similarly, if the given sequence is geometric progression, print the next progression element.

Print 42 if the given sequence is not an arithmetic or geometric progression.

QUESTION:
Ilya lives in a beautiful city of Chordalsk.

There are $n$ houses on the street Ilya lives, they are numerated from $1$ to $n$ from left to right; the distance between every two neighboring houses is equal to $1$ unit. The neighboring houses are $1$ and $2$, $2$ and $3$, ..., $n-1$ and $n$. The houses $n$ and $1$ are not neighboring.

The houses are colored in colors $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ so that the $i$-th house is colored in the color $c_i$. Everyone knows that Chordalsk is not boring, so there are at least two houses colored in different colors.

Ilya wants to select two houses $i$ and $j$ so that $1 \leq i < j \leq n$, and they have different colors: $c_i \neq c_j$. He will then walk from the house $i$ to the house $j$ the distance of $(j-i)$ units.

Ilya loves long walks, so he wants to choose the houses so that the distance between them is the maximum possible.

Help Ilya, find this maximum possible distance.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 300\,000$) — the number of cities on the street.

The second line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq n$) — the colors of the houses.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one pair of indices $i$ and $j$ so that $1 \leq i < j \leq n$ and $c_i \neq c_j$.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum possible distance Ilya can walk.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 2 3

Output
4

Input
3
1 2 1

Output
1

Input
7
1 1 3 1 1 1 1

Output
4



-----Note-----

In the first example the optimal way is to walk from the first house to the last one, where Ilya can walk the distance of $5-1 = 4$ units.

In the second example the optimal way is to either walk from the first house to the second or from the second to the third. Both these ways have the distance of $1$ unit.

In the third example the optimal way is to walk from the third house to the last one, where Ilya can walk the distance of $7-3 = 4$ units.

QUESTION:
Santa Claus is the first who came to the Christmas Olympiad, and he is going to be the first to take his place at a desk! In the classroom there are n lanes of m desks each, and there are two working places at each of the desks. The lanes are numbered from 1 to n from the left to the right, the desks in a lane are numbered from 1 to m starting from the blackboard. Note that the lanes go perpendicularly to the blackboard, not along it (see picture).

The organizers numbered all the working places from 1 to 2nm. The places are numbered by lanes (i. e. all the places of the first lane go first, then all the places of the second lane, and so on), in a lane the places are numbered starting from the nearest to the blackboard (i. e. from the first desk in the lane), at each desk, the place on the left is numbered before the place on the right. [Image] The picture illustrates the first and the second samples. 

Santa Clause knows that his place has number k. Help him to determine at which lane at which desk he should sit, and whether his place is on the left or on the right!


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2nm) — the number of lanes, the number of desks in each lane and the number of Santa Claus' place.


-----Output-----

Print two integers: the number of lane r, the number of desk d, and a character s, which stands for the side of the desk Santa Claus. The character s should be ""L"", if Santa Clause should sit on the left, and ""R"" if his place is on the right.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 9

Output
2 2 L

Input
4 3 24

Output
4 3 R

Input
2 4 4

Output
1 2 R



-----Note-----

The first and the second samples are shown on the picture. The green place corresponds to Santa Claus' place in the first example, the blue place corresponds to Santa Claus' place in the second example.

In the third sample there are two lanes with four desks in each, and Santa Claus has the fourth place. Thus, his place is in the first lane at the second desk on the right.

QUESTION:
Catherine has a deck of n cards, each of which is either red, green, or blue. As long as there are at least two cards left, she can do one of two actions:   take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with different colors and exchange them for a new card of the third color;  take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with the same color and exchange them for a new card with that color. 

She repeats this process until there is only one card left. What are the possible colors for the final card?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the total number of cards.

The next line contains a string s of length n — the colors of the cards. s contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single string of up to three characters — the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
RB

Output
G

Input
3
GRG

Output
BR

Input
5
BBBBB

Output
B



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Catherine has one red card and one blue card, which she must exchange for a green card.

In the second sample, Catherine has two green cards and one red card. She has two options: she can exchange the two green cards for a green card, then exchange the new green card and the red card for a blue card. Alternatively, she can exchange a green and a red card for a blue card, then exchange the blue card and remaining green card for a red card.

In the third sample, Catherine only has blue cards, so she can only exchange them for more blue cards.

QUESTION:
Dasha decided to have a rest after solving the problem. She had been ready to start her favourite activity — origami, but remembered the puzzle that she could not solve.  [Image] 

The tree is a non-oriented connected graph without cycles. In particular, there always are n - 1 edges in a tree with n vertices.

The puzzle is to position the vertices at the points of the Cartesian plane with integral coordinates, so that the segments between the vertices connected by edges are parallel to the coordinate axes. Also, the intersection of segments is allowed only at their ends. Distinct vertices should be placed at different points. 

Help Dasha to find any suitable way to position the tree vertices on the plane.

It is guaranteed that if it is possible to position the tree vertices on the plane without violating the condition which is given above, then you can do it by using points with integral coordinates which don't exceed 10^18 in absolute value.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) — the number of vertices in the tree. 

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integers u_{i}, v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n) that mean that the i-th edge of the tree connects vertices u_{i} and v_{i}.

It is guaranteed that the described graph is a tree.


-----Output-----

If the puzzle doesn't have a solution then in the only line print ""NO"".

Otherwise, the first line should contain ""YES"". The next n lines should contain the pair of integers x_{i}, y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| ≤ 10^18) — the coordinates of the point which corresponds to the i-th vertex of the tree.

If there are several solutions, print any of them.
